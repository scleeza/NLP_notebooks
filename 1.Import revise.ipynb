C.May 2002 JOINT MESSAGE FROM THE SECRETARY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OFEDUCATION, AND THE DIRECTOR, U.S. SECRET SERVICELittleton, Colorado; Springfield, Oregon; West Paducah, Kentucky; Jonesboro,Arkansas.  These communities have become familiar to many Americans as thelocations where school shootings have occurred in recent years.  School shootingsare a rare, but significant, component of school violence in America.  It is clear thatother kinds of problems are far more common than the targeted attacks that havetaken place in schools across this country.  However, each school-based attack hashad a tremendous and lasting effect on the school in which it occurred, thesurrounding community, and the nation as a whole.  In the aftermath of these tragicevents, educators, law enforcement officials, mental health professionals, parents,and others have asked: \"Could we have known that these attacks were beingplanned?\" and, \"What can be done to prevent future attacks from occurring?\"In June 1999, following the attack at Columbine High School, our two agencies--theU.S. Secret Service and the U.S. Department of Education--launched a collaborativeeffort to begin to answer these questions.  The result was the Safe School Initiative,an extensive examination of 37 incidents of targeted school shootings and schoolattacks that have occurred in the United States beginning with the earliest identifiedincident in 1974 through June 2000.  The focus of the Safe School Initiativewas onexamining the thinking, planning, and other behaviors engaged in by students whocarried out school attacks.  Particular attention was given to identifying pre-attackbehaviors and communications that might be detectable--or \"knowable\"--and couldhelp in preventing some future attacks. SAFE SCHOOL INITIATIVEFINAL REPORTii PREFACEiiiThe Safe School Initiativewas implemented through the Secret ServiceÕs NationalThreat Assessment Center and the Department of EducationÕs Safe and Drug-FreeSchools Program.  The Initiativedrew from the Secret ServiceÕs experience instudying and preventing assassination and other types of targeted violence and theDepartment of EducationÕs expertise in helping schools facilitate learning throughthe creation of safe environments for students, faculty, and staff.This document, the Safe School InitiativeÕs final report, details how our two agenciesstudied school-based attacks and what we found.  Some of the findings may surpriseyou.  It is clear that there is no simple explanation as to why these attacks haveoccurred.  Nor is there a simple solution to stop this problem.  But the findings ofthe Safe School Initiativedo suggest that some future attacks may be preventable, ifthose responsible for safety in schools know what questions to ask and where touncover information that may help with efforts to intervene before a school attackcan occur.Since it began in June 1999, our partnership has been a tremendous asset to each ofour respective agencies and vital to the success of this study.  It is our hope that theinformation we present in this final report is useful to those of you on the front linesof this problemÐthe administrators, educators, law enforcement officials, and otherswith protective responsibilities in schoolsÐand to anyone concerned with childrenÕssafety.  We encourage all of you in your efforts to keep our nationÕs children safe inschool and hope this report helps you in those efforts.Rod PaigeBrian L.

Moreover, theauthors are grateful to the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice ProgramsÕNational Institute of Justice for providing critical financial support that helped makethe study possible.In addition, Secret Service and Department of Education personnel benefitedsubstantially from the contributions of several law enforcement, behavioral scienceand mental health professionals whose collective experience and expertise helped toinform the development of the project plan and research design.  In alphabeticalorder, these individuals are: Gerardo Blue, Frederick Calhoun, Charles Ewing,Michael Gelles, Dennis McCarthy, Edward Mulvey, William Pollack, Larry Porte,Pam Robbins, Raymond Smyth, Sara Strizzi and Andrew Vita. This project would not have been possible without the support and guidance that theauthors received from several key officials and personnel at the Department ofEducation and the Secret Service.

These communities have become familiar to many Americans as amongthe locations of those schools where shootings have occurred nationwide in recentyears.  In the aftermath of these tragic events, educators, law enforcement officials,mental health professionals and parents have pressed for answers to two centralquestions: \"Could we have known that these attacks were being planned?\" and, if so,\"What could we have done to prevent these attacks from occurring?\"  This publication, The Final Report and Findings of the Safe School Initiative:Implications for the Prevention of School Attacks in the United States, is a recentproduct of an ongoing collaboration between the U. S. Secret Service and the U. S.Department of Education to begin to answer these questions.1It is the culminationof an extensive examination of 37 incidents of targeted school violence that occurredin the United States from December 1974 through May 2000.2The Following the attack at Columbine High School in April 1999, the Secret Service andthe Department of Education initiated, in June 1999, a study of the thinking,planning and other pre-attack behaviors engaged in by attackers who carried outschool shootings.   That study, the Safe School Initiative, was pursued under apartnership between the Secret Service and the Department of Education, andimplemented through the Secret ServiceÕs National Threat Assessment Center andthe Department of EducationÕs Safe and Drug-Free Schools Program.  In itsexecution, the Safe School Initiativedrew from the Secret ServiceÕs experience instudying and preventing targeted violence and from the Department of EducationÕsexpertise in helping schools facilitate learning through the creation of safeenvironments for students, faculty and staff.The objective of the Safe School Initiativewas to attempt to identify information thatcould be obtainable, or \"knowable,\" prior to an attack.  That information would thenbe analyzed and evaluated to produce a factual, accurate knowledge base on targetedschool attacks.  This knowledge could be used to help communities across thecountry to formulate policies and strategies aimed at preventing school-based attacks.Key features of the Safe School Initiativewere its focus on \"targeted\" school violenceand its adaptation of earlier Secret Service research on assassination for itsexamination of incidents of school-based attacks.1This report is an update and expansion of the earlier Interim Report on the Prevention of TargetedViolence in Schools,which was released in October 2000.  This Final Reportsupercedes the Interim Reportand should be used and referenced in place of the Interim Report.2See Section I, \"INTRODUCTION: THE SAFE SCHOOL INITIATIVE, Methodology,\" for a discussion of theapproach used by the Secret Service to identify incidents of school-based attacks. SAFE SCHOOL INITIATIVEFINAL REPORTThe Safe School Initiativeexamined incidents of \"targeted violence\" in schoolsettingsÐschool shootings and other school-based attacks where the school wasdeliberately selected as the location for the attack and was not simply a random siteof opportunity. The term \"targeted violence\" evolved from the Secret ServiceÕs five-year study of the behavior of individuals who have carried out, or attempted, lethalattacks on public officials or prominent individuals.  That study, the Secret ServiceÕsExceptional Case Study Project(ECSP), was initiated in 1992 under funding providedby the U. S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice ProgramsÕ National Institute ofJustice. The focus of the ECSP study was an operational analysis of the thinking and behaviorof those who have assassinated, attacked or tried to attack a national public officialor public figure in the United States since 1949.  The ECSP defined \"targetedviolence\" as any incident of violence where a known or knowable attacker selects aparticular target prior to their violent attack.3The purpose of the ECSP was togenerate a better understanding of attacks against public officials that, in turn, wouldhelp Secret Service agents in their investigations of threats toward the president andothers they protect and in the prevention of harm to these protected officials.4The ECSP sought to identify what information might be knowable prior to an attackand to better enable intervention before an attack occurred.  Findings from the ECSPhelped to dispel several myths and misconceptions about assassination.  In addition to the ECSPÕs particular focus on incidents involving attacks on publicofficials and prominent individuals, other types of violence in which a victim istargeted specifically include assassinations, stalking, some forms of domesticviolence, some types of workplace violence, and some types of school violence.  Inthe case of targeted school violence, the target may be a specific individual, such as aparticular classmate or teacher, or a group or category of individuals, such as \"jocks\"or \"geeks.\"  The target may even be the school itself.The findings of the ECSP also led to the Secret ServiceÕs development of a morethorough and focused process for conducting threat assessment investigations.  Aspart of its mission, the Secret Service is responsible for protecting the president andvice president of the United States and their families and certain national and43Fein, R., Vossekuil, B., & Holden, G.

CHAPTER I- INTRODUCTION5international leaders, all of whom are referred to as \"protectees.\"  The Secret Serviceprovides this protection by means of two distinct yet complementary strategies: theuse of physical measures--including magnetometers, armored vehicles, perimeters ofarmed agents, and canine units--that are designed to both deter potential attacks andserve as protective barriers in the event someone tries to attack; and a second, farless visible component known as threat assessment.  Threat assessment is a process of identifying, assessing and managing the threat thatcertain persons may pose to Secret Service protectees.  The goal of threat assessmentis to intervene before an attack can occur.  The threat assessment process involvesthree principal stepsÐall before the person has the opportunity to attack:¥ identifying individuals who have the idea or intent of attacking a SecretService protectee; ¥ assessing whether the individual poses a risk to a protectee, after gatheringsufficient information from multiple sources; and,¥ managing the threat the individual poses, in those cases where the individualinvestigated is determined to pose a threat.The Secret Service considers threat assessment to be as important to preventingtargeted violence as the physical measures it employs.In 1998, the Secret Service established the National Threat Assessment Center, anentity within the Secret Service that is dedicated to continuing efforts agency-wide tobetter understand and prevent targeted violence, and to share this developingknowledge with other constituencies responsible for public safety and violenceprevention.  Adaptation of its threat assessment protocols for use in addressing theproblem of school-based attacks is the most recent of the Secret ServiceÕs initiativesto share this body of knowledge and expertise with other constituencies engaged indeveloping strategies to address targeted violence issues.  In the late 1990s, theSecret Service and the Justice DepartmentÕs National Institute of Justice joined forcesto make information on the Secret ServiceÕs threat assessment protocols available toa wider law enforcement audience.  Protective Intelligence & Threat AssessmentInvestigations:  A Guide for State and Local Law Enforcement Officials,released inJuly 1998, offers state and local police officials insights into the elements of carryingout and evaluating the findings of threat assessment investigations.5In addition, since the release of the Safe School InitiativeInterim Report in October2000, personnel from the Secret Service and the Department of Education havegiven over 100 seminars and briefings on the study to thousands of educators, law5Fein, R. & Vossekuil, B.

Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs,National Institute of Justice:  Washington, D.C. SAFE SCHOOL INITIATIVEFINAL REPORTenforcement officials, mental health professionals and others across the UnitedStates.  Several questions and discussion points raised by seminar attendees havebeen addressed in this final report.Finally, the Department of Education and the Secret Service currently are completingwork on a guide to investigating and responding to threats in schools.  The guide isscheduled for publication in 2002.  The guide will include recommendations forinvestigating and evaluating threats and other behaviors of concern in school;address considerations for developing policies and capacity to support threatassessment efforts in schools; and provide suggestions for approaches schools canadopt to foster school environments that reduce threats of targeted violence.The Prevalence of Violence in American SchoolsPublic policymakers, school administrators, police officials and parents continue tosearch for explanations for the targeted violence that occurred at Columbine HighSchool and other schools across the country, and seek assurance that similarincidents will not be repeated at educational institutions in their communities.  Whilethe quest for solutions to the problem of targeted school violence is of criticalimportance, reports from the Department of Education, the Justice Department andother sources indicate that few children are likely to fall prey to life-threateningviolence in school settings.6To put the problem of targeted school-based attacks in context, from 1993 to 1997the odds that a child in grades 9-12 would be threatened or injured with a weapon inschool were 7 to 8 percent, or 1 in 13 or 14; the odds of getting into a physical fightat school were 15 percent, or 1 in 7.7In contrast, the odds that a child would die inschoolÐby homicide or suicideÐare, fortunately, no greater than 1 in 1 million.8In1998, students in grades 9-12 were the victims of 1.6 million thefts and 1.2 millionnonfatal violent crimes, while in this same period 60 school-associated violent deathswere reported for this student population.966See, for example, Kaufman, P., et. al.

CHAPTER I- INTRODUCTION7The findings of the Safe School InitiativeÕs extensive search for recorded incidents oftargeted school-based attacks underscore the rarity of lethal attacks in schoolsettings.   The Department of Education reports that nearly 60 million childrenattend the nationÕs 119,000+ schools.10The combined efforts of the Secret Serviceand the Department of Education identified 37 incidents of targeted school-basedattacks, committed by 41 individuals over a 25-year period.11Nevertheless, the impact of targeted school-based attacks cannot be measured instatistics alone. While it is clear that other kinds of problems in American schools arefar more common than the targeted violence that has taken place in schools in thiscountry, the high-profile shootings that have occurred in schools over the past decadehave resulted in increased fear among students, parents and educators.  Schoolshootings are a rare, but significant, component of the problem of school violence.Each school-based attack has had a tremendous and lasting effect on the school inwhich it occurred, the surrounding community and the nation as a whole.  In thewake of these attacks, fear of future targeted school violence has become a drivingforce behind the efforts of school officials, law enforcement professionals andparents to identify steps that can be taken to prevent incidents of violence in theirschools. MethodologyThe Secret Service and the Department of Education began work on the Safe SchoolInitiativestudy in June 1999.  Research protocols employed in carrying out andanalyzing the findings of this work reflect an adaptation of the ECSP operationalapproach to examining targeted attacks against public officials and prominentindividuals.  Researchers used a similar operational focus for the Safe SchoolInitiativeto develop information that could be useful to schools in betterunderstanding and preventing targeted violence in school settings.  The emphasis ofthe study was on examining the attackersÕ pre-incident thinking and behavior, toexplore information that could aid in preventing future attacks.For the purposes of this study, an incident of targeted school violence was defined asany incident where (i) a current student or recent former student attacked someoneat his or her school with lethal means (e.g., a gun or knife); and, (ii) where thestudent attacker purposefully chose his or her school as the location of the attack.Consistent with this definition, incidents where the school was chosen simply as asite of opportunity, such as incidents that were solely related to gang or drug tradeactivity or to a violent interaction between individuals that just happened to occur atthe school, were not included.10U.S. Department of Education. National Center for Education Statistics (2002). Digest of EducationStatistics 2000; Washington D.C.: Authors11Supranote 2. SAFE SCHOOL INITIATIVEFINAL REPORTUnder the studyÕs research strategy, each incident of targeted violence was assignedto a study review team comprised of criminal investigators and social scienceresearchers. At least two reviewers were assigned to each incident.The Secret Service and the Department of Education made every effort to ensurethat the Safe School Initiativewould produce information that would be useful forschool administrators, educators, law enforcement officials and others working withschools.  To that end, researchers consulted regularly with experts in the fields ofeducation, school violence and juvenile homicide, among others, in the course ofdeveloping the study design and protocols.  Feedback from these various experts wasincorporated into the final study design.  Researchers from the Secret Service and the Department of Education initiated theirstudy of targeted school violence with an extensive search for information that wouldidentify incidents of targeted school violence that have occurred in the United States.Beginning with June 2000 and working back in time, researchers explored allrelevant, searchable databases maintained in the public domain or available bysubscription, such as public news databases and professional publications, to identifyincidents meeting the definition of the study population.  Researchers also consultedwith law enforcement officials and school violence experts to develop leads onincidents of school violence that might meet the criteria for inclusion in the studyconstituency.In the end, researchers identified 37 incidents of targeted school violence involving41 attackers that occurred in the United States from 1974, the year in which theearliest incident identified took place, through June 2000, when data collection forthe study was completed.12The school-based attacks included in the Safe SchoolInitiativerepresent all of the incidents of targeted school violence meeting the studycriteria that Secret Service and Department of Education researchers were able toidentify in that time frame.Information on each incident of targeted school violence identified by Secret Serviceand Department of Education researchers was drawn principally from primary812It is possible that incidents of targeted school violence other than those identified by Safe School Initiativeresearchers might have occurred prior to the 1974 incident included in the study, or between 1974 andthe completion of data collection for the study in June 2000.  For example, incidents that met the studydefinition, but that were not identifiable under the study search strategy, or that were not reported asschool-based crimes, would have been unlikely to come to the attention of Secret Service and Departmentof Education researchers.  In addition, incidents of targeted school violence that have occurred since June2000 were outside the scope of the study. CHAPTER I- INTRODUCTION9source materials concerning the incident.  These primary source materials includedinvestigative, school, court, and mental health records. In addition, study researchers conducted supplemental interviews with 10 of theperpetrators of incidents of the school-based attacks identified by the Secret Serviceand the Department of Education.  These interviews provided researchers withfurther opportunity to examine the incident from the point of view of the attackerand to \"walk through the process of the attack\" from its conceptualization to itsexecution.  Insights gleaned from these interviews have been used by the SecretService primarily in training venues to illustrate particular aspects of incidents oftargeted school violence. Coding of Primary Source Materials.Each member of the review team assigned to a particular incident independentlyanswered several hundred questions about each case, entering his or her answers tothe questions in a codebook.   Review team members were instructed to recordinformation gathered from primary sources as it appeared in those sources, and notto engage in interpretation of facts presented.  Information gathered and reflected in incident reviewersÕ responses to the codedstudy questions included facts about:¥ the attackerÕs development of an idea to harm the target, and progressionfrom the original idea to the attack;¥ the attackerÕs selection of the target(s);¥ the attackerÕs motive(s) for the incident;¥ any communications made by the attacker about his or her ideas and intent,including any threats made to the target(s) or about the target(s);¥ evidence that the attacker planned the incident;¥ the attackerÕs mental health and substance abuse history, if any; and,¥ the attackerÕs life circumstances/situation at the time of the attack, includingrelationships with parents and other family members; performance in school;and treatment by fellow students.Information regarding the attackerÕs demographic characteristics and personalhistory, including criminal and school history, also were coded.  When each reviewerhad completed his or her response to the questions, the review team met as a wholeto compare responses and produce a single \"reconciled\" coding of the incident. SAFE SCHOOL INITIATIVEFINAL REPORTFindings presented in Chapter III of this report reflect researchersÕ careful analysis ofthe coded responses to the extensive questionnaire employed in recordinginformation gathered on each of the 37 school-based attacks and 41 attackers thatwere examined in the Safe School Initiative.  Researchers were cautious not tooverreach in drawing conclusions from this information.  Primary source materials reviewed for the 37 incidents did not provide answers inevery case to all of the areas of inquiry covered in the questionnaire.  In general,researchers declined to draw a conclusion if information directly responsive to aparticular area of inquiry was available for fewer than half of the incidents reviewed.Moreover, even when answers to a particular coded study question were available forthe majority of incidents, these responses collectively did not suggest in all cases acommon or shared characteristic.  Here again, researchers were cautious not to drawa conclusion in a particular area of inquiry if that conclusion was supported by fewerthan the majority of the responses to the subject question. However, in some cases, researchers believed that the absence of a common orshared characteristic or behavior in the coded responses to inquiriesÐmost notablywith respect to the characteristics and behaviors of the attackers--was sufficientlycompelling to note those observations as findings as well. Organization of the Final ReportThe remainder of this report is organized into four chapters.  Chapter II:\"Characteristics of Incidents of Targeted School Violence,\" presents basic descriptiveinformation about the attacks examined by the Safe School Initiative, includingincident, target and victim characteristics.  Chapter III: \"Findings of the Safe SchoolInitiative,\" describes the conclusions reached bySafe School Initiativeresearchersafter careful analysis of the facts and other information collected in the course of theSecret ServiceÕs and the Department of EducationÕs study of targeted schoolviolence.  Chapter IV: \"Implications of Safe School InitiativeFindings for the Prevention ofTargeted School Violence,\" will be of particular interest to educators, lawenforcement officials and others who are seeking guidance to inform efforts toaddress the problem of targeted school violence.  In this chapter, the authors focus inon 10 key findings of the Safe School Initiativethat appear to have implications for10 CHAPTER I- INTRODUCTION11the development of strategies to prevent targeted school violence.  These findingsspecifically concern what information was knownÐor knowableÐabout these incidentsprior to the attack, and that, in turn, might be relevant to efforts to prevent futureattacks.  Discussion of these key findings also includes consideration of how thisinformation might be applicable to investigating threats and other behavior in schoolsthat may raise concerns. In the final chapter of this report, Chapter V: \"Threat Assessment as a PromisingStrategy for Preventing School Violence,\" the authors offer some concludingobservations on how threat assessment protocols might be incorporated intostrategies to prevent targeted violence in schools. Overview of FindingsThe findings of the Safe School Initiativesuggest that there are productive actionsthat educators, law enforcement officials and others can pursue in response to theproblem of targeted school violence.  Specifically,Initiativefindings suggest thatthese officials may wish to consider focusing their efforts to formulate strategies forpreventing these attacks in two principal areas:¥ developing the capacity to pick up on and evaluate available or knowableinformation that might indicate that there is a risk of a targeted school attack;and,¥ employing the results of these risk evaluations or \"threat assessments\" indeveloping strategies to prevent potential school attacks from occurring. Support for these suggestions is found in 10 key findings of the Safe School Initiativestudy.  These findings are as follows:¥ Incidents of targeted violence at school rarely were sudden, impulsive acts.¥ Prior to most incidents, other people knew about the attackerÕs idea and/orplan to attack.¥ Most attackers did not threaten their targets directly prior to advancing theattack.¥ There is no accurate or useful \"profile\" of students who engaged in targetedschool violence.13¥ Most attackers engaged in some behavior prior to the incident that causedothers concern or indicated a need for help.¥ Most attackers had difficulty coping with significant losses or personalfailures.  Moreover, many had considered or attempted suicide.13Here the term \"profile\" refers to a set of demographic and other traits that a set of perpetrators of a crimehave in common.  Please refer to \"Characterizing the Attacker\" in Chapter III and to Reddy et al. (2001),\"Evaluating risk for targeted violence in schools\" in the Resources section for further explanation of the term\"profile.\" ¥ Many attackers felt bullied, persecuted or injured by others prior to theattack.¥ Most attackers had access to and had used weapons prior to the attack.¥ In many cases, other students were involved in some capacity.¥ Despite prompt law enforcement responses, most shooting incidents werestopped by means other than law enforcement intervention.SAFE SCHOOL INITIATIVEFINAL REPORT12 CHAPTER II- CHARACTERISTICS OF INCIDENTS CHAPTER IICHARACTERISTICS OFINCIDENTS OF TARGETEDSCHOOL VIOLENCE CHAPTER II- CHARACTERISTICS OF INCIDENTS OF TARGETED SCHOOL VIOLENCE15The Safe School Initiativefound that targeted school violence is not a new or recentphenomenon.  The earliest case that researchers were able to identify occurred in1974.  In that incident, a student brought guns and homemade bombs to his school;set off the fire alarm; and shot at emergency and custodial personnel who respondedto the alarm.The Safe School Initiativeidentified 37 incidents involving 41 attackers that met thestudy definition of targeted school violence and occurred between 1974 and the endof the 2000 school year.14These incidents took place in 26 states, with more thanone incident occurring in Arkansas, California, Kentucky, Missouri and Tennessee.15Analysis of the study findings identified the following characteristics of incidents oftargeted school violence: ¥ In almost three-quarters of the incidents, the attacker killed one or morestudents, faculty or others at the school (73 percent, n=2716).  In theremaining incidents, the attackers used a weapon to injure at least one personat school (24 percent, n=9).  In one incident, a student killed his family andthen held his class hostage with a weapon. ¥ More than one-half of the attacks occurred during the school day (59 percent,n=22), with fewer occurring before school (22 percent, n=8) or after school(16 percent, n=6).¥ Almost all of the attackers were current students at the school where theycarried out their attacks (95 percent, n=39).  Only two attackers were formerstudents of the school where they carried out their attacks at the time ofthose attacks (5 percent, n=2).¥ All of the incidents of targeted school violence examined in the Safe SchoolInitiativewere committed by boys or young men (100 percent, n=41).17¥ In most of the incidents, the attackers carried out the attack alone (81percent, n=30).  In four of the incidents, the attacker engaged in the attack onhis own but had assistance in planning the attack (11 percent, n=4).  In threeincidents, two or more attackers carried out the attack together (8 percent,n=3).14See Appendix B for a list of the dates of the incidents of targeted school violence examined by the SafeSchool Initiative.15See Appendix A for a list of the locations of the incidents of targeted school violence studied under theSafe School Initiative.16\"N\" refers to the number of attackers that corresponds to the reported percentage.  Unless indicatedotherwise, when the finding pertains to total attackers all NÕs are out of a total of 41.  When the findingpertains to total incidents (i.e., school-based attacks) all NÕs are out of a total of 37 incidents. 17While all the attackers in this study were boys, it would be misleading to read the findings of this study assuggesting that a girl could not or would not carry out a school-based attack.  For example, an incidentoccurred after the completion of this study in which a girl shot her classmate at a parochial school inWilliamsport, Pa.  In addition, a well-publicized school shooting that occurred in San Diego, Calif., in 1976was carried out by a woman.  The San Diego incident was not included in this study because the attackerwas not a current or former student of the school where she conducted her attack, but, rather, lived acrossthe street from the school.   SAFE SCHOOL INITIATIVEFINAL REPORT¥ Most attackers used some type of gun as their primary weapon, with over halfof the attackers using handguns (61 percent, n=25), and nearly half of themusing rifles or shotguns (49 percent, n=20).18Three-quarters of the attackersused only one weapon (76 percent, n=31) to harm their victims, althoughalmost half of the attackers had more than one weapon with them at time ofthe attack (46 percent, n=19).Target and Victim CharacteristicsPerpetrators of incidents of targeted school violence chose a range of targets for theirattacks, including fellow students, faculty and staff, and the school itself.  Theseincidents were usually planned in advance and for most part included intent to harma specific, pre-selected target, whether or not the attackerÕs execution of the incident,in fact, resulted in harm to the target.Target and victim characteristics identified by the Safe School Initiativewere:¥ In over half of the incidents (54 percent, n=22), the attacker had selected atleast one school administrator, faculty member or staff member as a target.Students were chosen as targets in fewer than half of the incidents (41percent, n=15).¥ In nearly half of the incidents, the attackers were known to have chosen morethan one target prior to their attack (44 percent, n=16).¥ Most attackers had a grievance against at least one of their targets prior to theattack (73 percent, n=30).19¥ In almost half of the incidents (46 percent, n=17), individuals who weretargeted prior to the attack also became victims (i.e., individuals actuallyharmed in the attack).  However, other individuals at the school, who werenot identified as original targets of the attack, were injured or killed as well.Among these non-targeted individuals, over half were other students (57percent, n=21) and over one-third (39 percent, n=16) were schooladministrators, faculty or staff.1618These percentages include all weapons used (i.e., discharged) in the attack, and therefore total morethan 100 percent. 19For the purposes of this study, \"grievance\" was defined as \"a belief that some other person ororganization is directly or indirectly responsible for injury or harm to self and/or someone whom thesubject cares about.\"  CHAPTER III- FINDINGS OF THE SAFE SCHOOL INITIATIVECHAPTER IIIFINDINGS OF THE SAFESCHOOL INITIATIVE CHAPTER III- FINDINGS OF THE SAFE SCHOOL INITIATIVE19The findings of researchersÕ analysis of the 37 incidents of targeted school violencethat were examined under the Safe School Initiativefall generally into five areas:¥ characterizing the attacker;¥ conceptualizing the attack;¥ signaling the attack;¥ advancing the attack; and,¥ resolving the attack.The findings in each of these areas are presented and explained below.Characterizing the AttackerFinding There is no accurate or useful \"profile\" of students who engaged in targeted school violence.20Explanation  Although all of the attackers in this study were boys, there is no set of traits thatdescribed allÐor even mostÐof the attackers.  Instead, they varied considerably indemographic, background and other characteristics.¥ The attackers ranged in age from 11 to 21, with most attackers between theages of 13 and 18 at the time of the attack (85 percent, n=35).  ¥ Three-quarters of the attackers were white (76 percent, n=31).  One-quarterof the attackers came from other racial and ethnic backgrounds, includingAfrican American (12 percent, n=5), Hispanic (5 percent, n=2), NativeAlaskan (2 percent, n=1), Native American (2 percent, n=1), and Asian (2percent, n=1).The attackers came from a variety of family situations, ranging from intact familieswith numerous ties to the community, to foster homes with histories of neglect.¥ Almost two-thirds of the attackers came from two-parent families (63 percent,n=26), living either with both biological parents (44 percent, n=18) or withone biological parent and one stepparent (19 percent, n=8).  ¥ Some lived with one biological parent (19 percent, n=8) or split time betweentwo biological parents (2 percent, n=1).¥ Very few lived with a foster parent or legal guardian (5 percent, n=2).20Supranote 13. SAFE SCHOOL INITIATIVEFINAL REPORTFor those incidents for which information on the attackersÕ school performance wasavailable, that information indicates that those attackers differed considerably fromone another in their academic achievement in school, with grades ranging fromexcellent to failing (n=34). ¥ The attackers in the largest grouping were doing well in school at the time ofthe attack, generally receiving As and Bs in their courses (41 percent; n=17);some were even taking Advanced Placement courses at the time of theincident or had been on the honor roll repeatedly.¥ Fewer of the attackers were receiving Bs and Cs (15 percent, n=6), or Cs andDs (22 percent, n=9).¥ Very few of the attackers were known to be failing in school (5 percent, n=2).Attackers also varied in the types of social relationships they had established, rangingfrom socially isolated to popular among their peers.¥ The largest group of attackers for whom this information was availableappeared to socialize with mainstream students or were consideredmainstream students themselves (41 percent, n=17).¥ One-quarter of the attackers (27 percent, n=11) socialized with fellowstudents who were disliked by most mainstream students or were consideredto be part of a \"fringe\" group.¥ Few attackers had no close friends (12 percent, n=5).¥ One-third of attackers had been characterized by others as \"loners,\" or feltthemselves to be loners (34 percent, n=14).¥ However, nearly half of the attackers were involved in some organized socialactivities in or outside of school (44 percent, n=18).  These activities includedsports teams, school clubs, extracurricular activities and mainstream religiousgroups. AttackersÕ histories of disciplinary problems at school also varied.  Some attackershad no observed behavioral problems, while others had multiple behaviorswarranting reprimand and/or discipline.¥ Nearly two-thirds of the attackers had never been in trouble or rarely were introuble at school (63 percent, n=26).¥ One-quarter of the attackers had ever been suspended from school (27percent, n=11).¥ Only a few attackers had ever been expelled from school (10 percent, n=4).Most attackers showed no marked changein academic performance (56 percent,n=23), friendship patterns (73 percent, n=30), interest in school (59 percent, n=24),or school disciplinary problems (68 percent, n=28) prior to their attack.20 CHAPTER III- FINDINGS OF THE SAFE SCHOOL INITIATIVE21¥ A few attackers even showed some improvementsin academic performance (5percent, n=2) or declinesin disciplinary problems at school (7 percent, n=3)prior to the attack.  In one case, the dean of students had commended astudent a few weeks before he attacked his school for improvements in hisgrades and a decline in the number of disciplinary problems involving thatstudent in school.FindingMany attackers felt bullied, persecuted or injured by others prior to the attack.ExplanationAlmost three-quarters of the attackers felt persecuted, bullied, threatened, attackedor injured by others prior to the incident (71percent, n=29).21In several cases, individual attackers had experienced bullying and harassment thatwas long-standing and severe.  In some of these cases the experience of being bulliedseemed to have a significant impact on the attacker and appeared to have been afactor in his decision to mount an attack at the school.22In one case, most of theattackerÕs schoolmates described the attacker as \"the kid everyone teased.\"   Inwitness statements from that incident, schoolmates alleged that nearly every child inthe school had at some point thrown the attacker against a locker, tripped him in thehall, held his head under water in the pool or thrown things at him.  Severalschoolmates had noted that the attacker seemed more annoyed by, and less tolerantof, the teasing than usual in the days preceding the attack.FindingA history of having been the subject of a mental health evaluation, diagnosed with amental disorder, or involved in substance abuse did not appear to be prevalentamong attackers.  However, most attackers showed some history of suicidal attemptsor thoughts, or a history of feeling extreme depression or desperation.Explanation¥ Only one-third of attackers had ever received a mental health evaluation (34percent, n=14), and fewer than one-fifth had been diagnosed with mentalhealth or behavior disorder prior to the attack (17 percent, n=7).  21It is important to note that the way in which information was gathered for the Safe School Initiativedidnot permit researchers to determine the exact proportion of attackers who had been victims of bullyingspecifically. Moreover, not every attacker in this study felt bullied.22The Safe School InitiativeÕs approach to gathering information concerning incidents of targeted schoolviolence did not permit researchers to determine conclusively whether the experience of being bullied--orperceptions that they had been bullied--causedthe attacker to engage in targeted school violence. SAFE SCHOOL INITIATIVEFINAL REPORT¥ Although most attackers had not received a formal mental health evaluationor diagnosis, most attackers exhibited a history of suicide attempts or suicidalthoughts at some point prior to their attack (78 percent, n=32).  More thanhalf of the attackers had a documented history of feeling extremely depressedor desperate (61 percent, n=25).¥ Approximately one-quarter of the attackers had a known history of alcohol orsubstance abuse (24 percent, n=10).¥ The only information collected that would indicate whether attackers hadbeen prescribed psychiatric medications concerned medication non-compliance (i.e., failure to take medication as prescribed).  Ten percent of theattackers (n=4) were known to be non-compliant with prescribed psychiatricmedications. FindingOver half of the attackers demonstrated some interest in violence, through movies,video games, books, and other media (59 percent, n=24).  However, there was noone common type of interest in violence indicated.  Instead, the attackersÕ interest inviolent themes took various forms.  Explanation¥ Approximately one-quarter of the attackers had exhibited an interest in violentmovies (27 percent, n=11).¥ Approximately one-quarter of the attackers had exhibited an interest in violentbooks (24 percent, n=10). ¥ One-eighth of the attackers exhibited an interest in violent video games (12percent, n=5).¥ The largest group of attackers exhibited an interest in violence in their ownwritings, such as poems, essays or journal entries (37 percent, n=15).FindingMost attackers had no history of prior violent or criminal behavior.Explanation¥ Fewer than one-third of the attackers were known to have acted violentlytoward others at some point prior to the incident (31 percent, n=13).¥ Very few of the attackers were known to have harmed or killed an animal atany time prior to the incident (12 percent, n=5).¥ Approximately one-quarter of the attackers had a prior history of arrest (27percent, n=11).22 CHAPTER III- FINDINGS OF THE SAFE SCHOOL INITIATIVE23Finding Most attackers were known to have had difficulty coping with significant losses orpersonal failures.  Moreover, many had considered or attempted suicide.ExplanationMost attackers appeared to have difficulty coping with losses, personal failures orother difficult circumstances.  Almost all of the attackers had experienced orperceived some major loss prior to the attack (98 percent, n=40).  These lossesincluded a perceived failure or loss of status (66 percent, n=27); loss of a loved oneor of a significant relationship, including a romantic relationship (51 percent, n=21);and a major illness experienced by the attacker or someone significant to him (15percent, n=6).  In one case, the attacker, who was a former student at the schoolwhere the attack occurred, was laid off from his job because he did not have a highschool diploma.  The attacker blamed the job loss on the teacher who failed him in asenior-year course, which kept him from graduating.  He returned to the school ayear after leaving the school, killed his former teacher and two students, and thenheld over 60 students hostage for 10 hours.For most attackers, their outward behaviors suggested difficulty in coping with loss(83 percent, n=34).  For example, the mother, the brother and a friend of theattacker who lost his job each had commented that the attacker became depressedand withdrawn following the lay-off.  The friend also reported that he knew that theattacker blamed his former teacher for his problems and had begun planning how toretaliate.Conceptualizing the AttackFinding  Incidents of targeted violence at school rarelyare sudden, impulsive acts.ExplanationSeveral findings of the Safe School Initiativeindicate clearly that the school-basedattacks studied were rarely impulsive.  Rather, these attacks typically were thoughtout beforehand and involved some degree of advance planning.  In many cases, theattackerÕs observable behavior prior to the attack suggested he might be planning orpreparing for a school attack.In nearly all of the incidents for which information concerning the attackerÕsconceptualization of the attack was available, researchers found that the attacker had SAFE SCHOOL INITIATIVEFINAL REPORTdeveloped his idea to harmthe target(s) before the attack (95 percent, n=39).  Thelength of time that attackers held this idea prior to the actual attack variedconsiderably.  Some attackers conceived of the attack as few as one or two days priorto advancing that attack; other attackers had held the idea of the attack for as long asa year prior to carrying it out.  For those incidents where information was availableto determine how long the attacker had an idea to harm the target (n=33), theanalysis showed that a little over half of the attackers developed their idea for theincident at least a month prior to the attack (51 percent, n=17).In addition, almost all of the attackersplannedout the attack in advance of carryingit out (93 percent; n=38).  Moreover, there was evidence from the attackerÕsbehaviorprior to the attack that the attacker had a plan or was preparing to harm the target(s)(93 percent, n=38).  For example, one attacker asked his friends to help him getammunition for one of his weapons; sawed off the end of a rifle to make it easier toconceal beneath his clothes; shopped for a long trench coat with his mother; and cutthe pockets out of the coat so that he could conceal the weapon within the coat whileholding the weapon through one of the cut-out pockets.  That attacker had a well-known fascination with weapons and had told his friends on several occasions thathe thought about killing certain students at school.  The length of time between the planning and execution of the attacks also variedconsiderably for the targeted school violence incidents studied.  Some attackersdeveloped their plans on the day of their attack or only one or two days prior; othersdeveloped their plans between six and eight months prior to the attack.  In caseswhere there was information available to establish the date planning began (n=29),analysis of available information revealed that most of the attackers developed a planat least two days prior to the attack (69 percent, n=21).Revenge was a motive for more than half of the attackers (61 percent, n=25).  Othermotives included trying to solve a problem (34 percent, n=14); suicide or desperation(27 percent, n=11); and efforts to get attention or recognition (24 percent, n=10).More than half of the attackers had multiplemotives or reasons for their school-based attacks (54 percent, n=22).  In addition, most of the attackers held some sortof grievance at the time of the attack, either against their target(s) or againstsomeone else (81 percent, n=33).  Many attackers told other people about thesegrievances prior to their attacks (66 percent, n=27).232423Supranote 19. CHAPTER III- FINDINGS OF THE SAFE SCHOOL INITIATIVE25Signaling the AttackFinding Prior to most incidents, other people knew about the attackerÕs idea and/or plan toattack.ExplanationIn most cases, other people knew about the attack before it took place.  In overthree-quarters of the incidents, at least one person had information that the attackerwas thinking about or planning the school attack (81 percent, n=30).  In nearly two-thirds of the incidents, more than oneperson had information about the attackbefore it occurred (59 percent, n=22).  In nearly all of these cases, the person whoknew was a peerÐa friend, schoolmate, or sibling (93 percent, n=28/30).  Somepeers knew exactly what the attacker planned to do; others knew something \"big\" or\"bad\" was going to happen, and in several cases knew the time and date it was tooccur.  An adult had information about the idea or plan in only two cases. In one incident, for example, the attacker had planned to shoot students in the lobbyof his school prior to the beginning of the school day.  He told two friends exactlywhat he had planned and asked three others to meet him that morning in themezzanine overlooking the lobby, ostensibly so that these students would be out ofharmÕs way.  On most mornings, usually only a few students would congregate on themezzanine before the school day began.  However, by the time the attacker arrived atschool on the morning of the attack, word about what was going to happen hadspread to such an extent that 24 students were on the mezzanine waiting for theattack to begin.  One student who knew the attack was to occur brought a camera sothat he could take pictures of the event.FindingMost attackers did not threaten their targets directly prior to advancing the attack.ExplanationThe majority of the attackers in the targeted school violence incidents examinedunder the Safe School Initiativedid not threaten their target(s) directly, i.e., did nottell the target they intended to harm them, whether in direct, indirect or conditionallanguage prior to the attack.  Only one-sixth of the attackers threatened theirtarget(s) directly prior to the attack (17 percent, n=7).  SAFE SCHOOL INITIATIVEFINAL REPORTFinding Most attackers engaged in some behavior, prior to the incident, that caused othersconcern or indicated a need for help.ExplanationAlmost all of the attackers engaged in some behavior prior to the attack that causedothersÐschool officials, parents, teachers, police, fellow studentsÐto be concerned(93 percent, n=38).  In most of the cases, at least one adultwas concerned by theattackerÕs behavior (88 percent, n=36).  In three-quarters of the cases, at least threepeopleÐadults and other childrenÐwere concerned by the attackerÕs behavior (76percent, n=31).  In one case, for example, the attacker made comments to at least 24friends and classmates about his interest in killing others kids, building bombs orcarrying out an attack at the school.  A school counselor was so concerned about thisstudentÕs behavior that the counselor asked to contact the attackerÕs parents.  TheattackerÕs parents also knew of his interest in guns.  The behaviors that led other individuals to be concerned about the attacker includedboth behaviors specifically related to the attack, such as efforts to get a gun, as wellas other disturbing behaviors not related to the subsequent attack.  In one case, thestudentÕs English teacher became concerned about several poems and essays that thestudent submitted for class assignments because they treated the themes of homicideand suicide as possible solutions to his feelings of despair.  In another case, thestudent worried his friends by talking frequently about plans to put rat poison in thecheese shakers at a popular pizza establishment.  A friend of that student became soconcerned that the student was going to carry out the rat poison plan, that the friendgot out of bed late one night and left his house in search of his mother, who was nothome at the time, to ask her what to do.Advancing the AttackFinding In many cases, other students were involved in the attack in some capacity.ExplanationAlthough most attackers carried out their attacks on their own, many attackers wereinfluenced or encouraged by others to engage in the attacks.  Nearly half of theattackers were influenced by other individuals in deciding to mount an attack, daredor encouraged by others to attack, or both (44 percent; n=18).  For example, oneattackerÕs original idea had been to bring a gun to school and let other students see26 CHAPTER III- FINDINGS OF THE SAFE SCHOOL INITIATIVE27him with it.  He wanted to look tough so that the students who had been harassinghim would leave him alone.  When he shared this idea with two friends, however,they convinced him that exhibiting the gun would not be sufficient and that he wouldhave toshoot atpeople at the school in order to get the other students to leave himalone.  It was after this conversation that this student decided to mount his schoolattack.In other cases, friends assisted the attacker in his efforts to acquire a weapon orammunition, discussed tactics for getting a weapon into school undetected, or helpedgather information about the whereabouts of a target at a particular time during theschool day.Finding Most attackers had access to and had used weapons prior to the attack.ExplanationExperience using weapons and access to them was common for many attackers.Nearly two-thirds of the attackers had a known history of weapons use, includingknives, guns and bombs (63 percent, n=26).  Over half of the attackers had someexperience specifically with a gun prior to the incident (59 percent, n=24), whileothers had experience with bombs or explosives (15 percent, n=6).  However, fewerthan half of the attackers demonstrated any fascination or excessive interest withweapons (44 percent, n=18), and less than one-third showed a fascination withexplosives (32 percent, n=13) prior to their attacks.  Over two-thirds of the attackersacquired the gun (or guns) used in their attacks from their own home or that of arelative (68 percent, n=28).Resolving the AttackFinding Despite prompt law enforcement responses, most attacks were stopped by meansother than law enforcement intervention.ExplanationMost school-based attacks were stopped through intervention by schooladministrators, educators and students-or by the attacker stopping on his own.  Inabout one-third of the incidents, the attacker was apprehended by or surrendered toadministrators, faculty, or school staff (27 percent, n=10) or to students (5 percent,n=2).  In just over one-fifth of the incidents, the attacker stopped on his own or left SAFE SCHOOL INITIATIVEFINAL REPORTthe school (22 percent, n=8).  In a few incidents, the attacker killed himself duringthe course of the incident (13 percent, n=5). Just over one-quarter of the incidents were stopped through law enforcementintervention (27 percent, n=10).  Law enforcement personnel discharged weapons inonly three of the incidents of targeted school violence studied (8 percent, n=3).Close to half of the incidents were known to last 15 minutes or less from thebeginning of the shooting to the time the attacker was apprehended, surrendered orstopped shooting (47 percent, n=16).24One-quarter of the incidents were over withinfive minutes of their inception (27 percent, n=9).  The fact that it was not throughlaw enforcement intervention that most of the targeted school violence incidentsstudied were stopped appears in large part to be a function of how brief most ofthese incidents were in duration.  2824Information on incident duration was not available for seven of the incidents (19 percent). CHAPTER IV- IMPLICATIONS OF INITIATIVE FINDINGSCHAPTER IVIMPLICATIONS OF SAFESCHOOL INITIATIVEFINDINGSFOR THE PREVENTION OFTARGETED SCHOOLVIOLENCE CHAPTER IV- IMPLICATIONS OF SAFE SCHOOL INITIATIVE FINDINGS31After careful review of the case histories of the 37 incidents of targeted schoolviolence examined under the Safe School Initiative, 10 key findings were identifiedthat highlight information that may have been known or knowable prior to school-based attacks and that therefore might inform some type of intervention in orprevention of future attacks.  In this chapter, the authors discuss the implicationsthat these findings may have for schools and communities in developing strategies forpreventing targeted violence in schools.  In focusing in on these findings for their potential relevance to the development ofprevention and intervention strategies, the authors acknowledge that these findingsmay raise other issues for consideration in addressing the problem of targeted schoolviolence beyond those noted here.  Moreover, the authors recognize that theconditions, circumstances and facts underlying the findings highlighted here may notmanifest themselves in the same way in every school.  Schools and communitiestherefore are in the best position to determine whether and how these findings andthe implications suggested may apply to their particular problems and needs.The 10 key findings that the authors believe may have implications for thedevelopment of strategies to address the problem of targeted school violence are asfollows:¥ Incidents of targeted violence at school rarely are sudden, impulsive acts.¥ Prior to most incidents, other people knew about the attackerÕs idea and/orplan to attack.¥ Most attackers did not threaten their targets directly prior to advancing theattack.¥ There is no accurate or useful profile of students who engaged in targetedschool violence. ¥ Most attackers engaged in some behavior prior to the incident that causedothers concern or indicated a need for help.¥ Most attackers had difficulty coping with significant losses or personalfailures.  Moreover, many had considered or attempted suicide.¥ Many attackers felt bullied, persecuted or injured by others prior to theattack.¥ Most attackers had access to and had used weapons prior to the attack.¥ In many cases, other students were involved in some capacity.¥ Despite prompt law enforcement responses, most shooting incidents werestopped by means other than law enforcement intervention. SAFE SCHOOL INITIATIVEFINAL REPORTThe Implications of Key Study FindingsKey Finding 1 Incidents of targeted violence at school rarelyare sudden, impulsive acts.Implications  Students who engaged in school-based attacks typically did not \"just snap\" and thenengage in impulsive or random acts of targeted school violence.  Instead, the attacksexamined under the Safe School Initiativeappeared to be the end result of acomprehensible process of thinking and behavior: behavior that typically began withan idea, progressed to the development of a plan, moved on to securing the means tocarry out the plan and culminated in an attack. This is a process that potentially maybe knowable or discernible from the attackerÕs behaviors and communications.To the extent that information about an attackerÕs intent and planning is knowableand may be uncovered before an incident, some attacks may be preventable.However, findings from the Safe School Initiativesuggest that the time span betweenthe attackerÕs decision to mount an attack and the actual incident may be short.Consequently, when indications that a student may pose a threat to the schoolcommunity arise in the form of revelations about a planned attack, schooladministrators and law enforcement officials will need to move quickly to inquireabout and intervene in that plan.25Key Finding 2Prior to most incidents, other people knew about the attackerÕs idea and/or plan toattack.  In most cases, those who knew were other kidsÐfriends, schoolmates,siblings, and others.  However, this information rarely made its way to an adult.ImplicationsFirst and foremost, this finding suggests that students can be an important part ofprevention efforts.  A friend or schoolmate may be the first person to hear that astudent is thinking about or planning to harm someone.  Nevertheless, for a varietyof reasons, those who have information about a potential incident of targeted schoolviolence may not alert an adult on their own.  Schools can encourage students toreport this information in part by identifying and breaking down barriers in the3225The Department of Education and the Secret Service have prepared a companion work to the FinalReport, Threat Assessment in Schools: A Guide to Managing Threatening Situations and Creating Safe SchoolClimates.  This guide is scheduled for publication in May 2002.  The guide will include recommendations forinvestigating and evaluating threats and other behaviors of concern in school; address considerations fordeveloping policies and the capacity to support threat assessment efforts in schools; and providesuggestions for approaches schools can adopt to foster school environments that reduce violence. CHAPTER IV- IMPLICATIONS OF SAFE SCHOOL INITIATIVE FINDINGS33school environment that inadvertently may discourage students from coming forwardwith this information.  Schools also may benefit from ensuring that they have a fair,thoughtful and effective system to respond to whatever information students do bringforward.  If students have concerns about how adults will react to information thatthey bring forward, they may be even less inclined to volunteer such information.In addition, this finding highlights the importance in an inquiry of attempts to gatherall relevant information from anyone who may have contact with the student. Effortsto gather all potentially relevant pieces of information, however innocuous they mayappear on their own, from all individuals with whom the student has contact mayhelp to develop a more comprehensive picture of the studentÕs ideas, activities andplans.  In the end, investigators may find that different people in the studentÕs lifehave different pieces of the puzzle.  Key Finding 3Most attackers did not threaten their targets directly prior to advancing the attack.ImplicationsThis finding underscores the importance of not waitingfor a threat before beginningan inquiry.  The Safe School Initiativefound that most attackers in fact did notthreaten their target directly and some made no threat at all.  Instead, otherbehaviors and communications that may prompt concern, such as hearing that achild is talking about bringing a gun to school, are indicators that the child may posea threat and therefore should prompt the initiation of efforts to gather information.  School administrators should respond to all students who make threats.  The lack ofresponse could be taken by the threatener as permission to proceed with carryingout the threat.  In the end, however, it is important to distinguish between someonewho makesa threatÐtells people they intend to harm someoneÐand someone whoposesa threatÐengages in behaviors that indicate an intent, planning or preparationfor an attack.  Those conducting inquiries should focus particular attention on anyinformation that indicates that a student posesa threat, regardless of whether thestudent has told a potential target he or she intends to do them harm.Key Finding 4There is no accurate or useful profile of students who engaged in targeted schoolviolence.  ImplicationsThe demographic, personality, school history, and social characteristics of theattackers varied substantially. Knowing that a particular student shares SAFE SCHOOL INITIATIVEFINAL REPORTcharacteristics, behaviors, features or traits with prior school shooters does not helpin determining whether that student is thinking about or planning for a violent act.The use of profiles in this way likewise is not an effective approach to identifyingstudents who may pose a risk for targeted school violence at school or for assessingthe risk that a particular student may pose for a school-based attack, once aparticular student has been identified.  Reliance on profiles to predict future schoolattacks carries two substantial risks: (1) the great majority of students who fit anygiven profile of a \"school shooter\" will not actually pose a risk of targeted violence;and, (2) using profiles will fail to identify some students who in fact pose a risk ofviolence but share few if any characteristics with prior attackers.26Rather than trying to determine the \"type\" of student who may engage in targetedschool violence, an inquiry should focus instead on a studentÕsbehaviors andcommunicationsto determine if that student appears to be planning or preparing foran attack.  Rather than asking whether a particular student \"looks like\" those whohave launched school-based attacks before, it is more productive to ask whether thestudent is engaging in behaviors that suggest preparations for an attack, if so howfast the student is moving toward attack, and where intervention may be possible.Key Finding 5Most attackers engaged in some behavior, prior to the incident, that caused othersconcern or indicated a need for help.ImplicationsSeveral key findings point to the fact that kids send signalsÐboth directly andindirectlyÐto others regarding their problems.  The boys who engaged in the targetedschool violence examined by the Safe School Initiativewere not \"invisible\" students.In fact nearly all of these students engaged in behaviors--prior to their attacks--thatcaused concern to at least one person, usually an adult, and most concerned at leastthree people.This finding highlights the range of behaviors in a studentÕs life that may benoticeable and that could prompt some additional probing by a caring adult.  AstudentÕs family, teachers, friends and others may have information regarding aspectsof a studentÕs behavior that has raised concern.  As was true in some of the incidentscovered in this study, individuals in contact with the attacker may have observedsomething of concern about that studentÕs behavior, but not of sufficient concern forthem to notify anyone in a position to respond.  3426Please refer to Reddy et al. (2001), \"Evaluating risk for targeted violence in schools: Comparing riskassessment, threat assessment, and other approaches,\" for a full discussion of assessment approachescurrently available to schools.  The full citation for the article is listed in Appendix C of this document. CHAPTER IV- IMPLICATIONS OF SAFE SCHOOL INITIATIVE FINDINGS35Educators and other adults can learn how to pick up on these signals and makeappropriate referrals.27By inquiring about any information that may have promptedsome concern, an investigator may be able to develop a more comprehensive pictureof the studentÕs past and current behavior, and identify any indications that thestudent is intent on or planning to attack.  However, discretion should be exercisedin determining whom to talk to about the student, so as not to alienate or stigmatizethe student of concern.  A significant challenge facing schools is to determine howbest to respond to students who are already known to be in trouble or needingassistance.Key Finding 6 Most attackers had difficulty coping with significant losses or personal failures.Many had considered or attempted suicide.ImplicationsMany students, not just those who engaged in school-based attacks, experience orperceive major losses in their lives.  Most students who face a significant loss, or whohave difficulty coping with such a loss, are not going to be at risk for a school-basedattack. However, information that indicates a student is facing or having troubledealing with a significantly difficult situation may indicate a need to refer the studentto appropriate services and resources. In cases where there is concern about the possibility that a student may engage intargeted violence, attention should be given to any indication that a student is havingdifficulty coping with major losses or perceived failures, particularly where theselosses or failures appear to have prompted feelings of desperation and hopelessness.An inquiry also should anticipate changes in the life of a troubled student, andconsider whether these changes might increaseÐor decreaseÐthe threat the studentposes.Key Finding 7Many attackers felt bullied, persecuted, or injured by others prior to the attack.ImplicationsBullying was not a factor in every case, and clearly not every child who is bullied inschool will pose a risk for targeted violence in school.  Nevertheless, in a number ofthe incidents of targeted school violence studied, attackers described being bullied interms that suggested that these experiences approached torment.  These attackers27See \"Early Warning, Timely Response,\" listed in Appendix C of this report, for more information abouthow to identify students who may need assistance. SAFE SCHOOL INITIATIVEFINAL REPORTtold of behaviors that, if they occurred in the workplace, likely would meet legaldefinitions of harassment and/or assault.  The prevalence of bullying found in this and other recent studies should stronglysupport ongoing efforts to reduce bullying in American schools.28Educators can playan important role in ensuring that students are not bullied in schools and thatschools not only do not permit bullying but also empower other students to let adultsin the school know if students are being bullied.Key Finding 8Most attackers had access to and had used weapons prior to the attack.ImplicationsAccess to weapons among some students may be common.  However, when the ideaof an attack exists, anyeffort to acquire, prepare or use a weapon or ammunitionmay be a significant move in the attackerÕs progression from idea to action.  Anyinquiry should include investigation of and attention to weapon access and use andcommunications about weapons.  Attention should also be given to indications of anyefforts by a student to build a bomb or acquire bomb-making components.The large proportion of attackers who acquired their guns from home points to theneed for schools and law enforcement officials to collaborate on policies andprocedures for responding when a student is thought to have a firearm in school.  Inparticular, schools should be aware of the provisions of the Federal Gun-FreeSchools Act, which requires that all schools expel students who bring a gun to schooland should report all violations to local law enforcement officials.29Key Finding 9 In many cases, other students were involved in the attack in some capacity.ImplicationsThis finding highlights the importance of considering what prompting orencouragement a student may receive from others in his life that influences hisintent, planning or preparations for a potential attack.  Any investigation of potentialtargeted school violence should include attention to the role that a studentÕs friendsor peers may be playing in that studentÕs thinking about and preparations for an3628See, for example, Nansel, T., Overpeck, M., Pilla, R., Ruan, J., Simons-Morton, B., & Scheidt, P.

CHAPTER IV- IMPLICATIONS OF SAFE SCHOOL INITIATIVE FINDINGS37attack.  It is possible that feedback from friends or others may help to move astudent from an unformed thought about attacking to developing and advancing aplan to carry out the attack.Key Finding 10Despite prompt law enforcement responses, most attacks were stopped by meansother than law enforcement intervention and most were brief in duration.ImplicationsThe short duration of most incidents of targeted school violence argues for theimportance of developing preventive measures in addition to any emergency planningfor a school or school district.  The preventive measures should include protocolsand procedures for responding to and managing threats and other behaviors ofconcern.  SAFE SCHOOL INITIATIVEFINAL REPORT38 CHAPTER V- CONCLUSION: A PROMISING STRATEGYCHAPTER VCONCLUSION: THREATASSESSMENT AS A PROMISINGSTRATEGY FOR PREVENTINGSCHOOL VIOLENCE CHAPTER V- CONCLUSION: THREAT ASSESSMENT AS A PROMISING STRATEGY41Taken together, the findings from the Safe School Initiativesuggest that some futureattacks may be preventable.  Most incidents of targeted school violence were thoughtout and planned in advance.  The attackersÕ behavior suggested that they wereplanning or preparing for an attack.  Prior to most incidents, the attackersÕ peersknew the attack was to occur.  And most attackers were not \"invisible,\" but alreadywere of concern to people in their lives.  In light of these findings, the use of a threat assessment approach may be apromising strategy for preventing a school-based attack. Educators, law enforcementofficials and others with public safety responsibilities may be able to prevent someincidents of targeted school violence if they know what information to look for andwhat to do with such information when it is found.  In sum, these officials maybenefit from focusing their efforts on formulating strategies for preventing theseattacks in two principal areas:¥ developing the capacity to pick up on and evaluate available or knowableinformation that might indicate that there is a risk of a targeted school attack;and,¥ employing the results of these risk evaluations or \"threat assessments\" indeveloping strategies to prevent potential school attacks from occurring.Threat Assessment and Targeted School Violence Prevention Threat assessment, as developed by the Secret Service and applied in the context oftargeted school violence, is a fact-based investigative and analytical approach thatfocuses on what a particular student is doing and saying, and not on whether thestudent \"looks like\" those who have attacked schools in the past.  Threat assessmentemphasizes the importance of such behavior and communications for identifying,evaluating and reducing the risk posed by a student who may be thinking about orplanning for a school-based attack. The Department of Education and the SecretService currently are completing work on a publication that will provide schooladministrators and law enforcement officials with guidance on planning andimplementing a threat assessment approach within school settings.30In relying on a fact-based threat assessment approach, school officials, lawenforcement professionals and others involved in the assessment will need tools,mechanisms and legal processes that can facilitate their efforts to gather and analyzeinformation regarding a studentÕs behavior and communications.  For example,school and law enforcement personnel should be offered training regarding whatinformation to gather, how to gather and evaluate it, and how they might try tointervene in cases where the information collected suggests a student may beplanning or preparing for a school-based attack.30Supranote 25. SAFE SCHOOL INITIATIVEFINAL REPORTSeveral states have enacted legislation that makes it easier for schools to sharestudent information with law enforcement agencies and others who are trying todetermine whether a student might be moving toward a school-based attack.31Localities and states may wish to explore such options for supporting threatassessment components in schools and facilitating sharing information across school,law enforcement and community systems participating in the threat assessmentprocess.Finally, educators can play a part in prevention by creating an environment wherestudents feel comfortable telling an adult whenever they hear about someone who isconsidering doing harm to another person, or even whether the person isconsidering harming themselves. Once such an environment is created, it will remainimportant that the adults in that environment listen to students and handle theinformation they receive in a fair and responsible manner.4231See \"Legal Issues\" in Appendix C of this report for listings of documents that include descriptions of statestatutes in this area.

As the eyes of the world were suddenly and glaringly thrust on the NIU community, the \\nmost important lesson learned was that in our time of grief, we were not alone. Thousands of \\nindividuals and institutions around the world extended sympathy and support to the university community in the days following February 14. Students from West Nickel Mines Amish School \\n\\nin Lancaster County, Pennsylvania (which suffered a tragic shooting in 2006 at the hands of a \\n\\nlone gunman) sent words of comfort and the watercolor ﬁHappier Days,ﬂ which shows children of tragedy and despair come hope and restoration. Over 500 professional counselors throughout the Midwest put their professional lives on hold and volunteered their time and talent to NIU students, faculty and staff to help ease the pain \\n\\ncreated in a single act of violence on that fateful February day. Dozens of volunteers from across \\n\\nthe country brought comfort dogs to DeKalb so that when our students returned to classes on \\nFebruary 25, 2008, they would be met by ﬁman™s best friends.ﬂ Many of our students hugged \\n\\n\\nThe people of DeKalb County rallied around NIU students and donated thousands of dollars in scholarship funds to remember our fallen Huskies. Hundreds of volunteers assembled over \\n50,000 donated cookies in ﬁWelcome Backﬂ gift bags that were left in dorm rooms and Holmes \\n\\nStudent Center for students to enjoy when they returned.\\nand counsel to NIU administrators and comfort to grieving families and our campus community. \\nSenator Durbin™s senior staff and staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee spent countless hours \\nassisting NIU administrators with marshalling federal assistance through the Department of Education and the Department of Justice. Many members of the Illinois congressional delegation traveled to NIU to attend the Campus Memorial Service on Sunday, February 24, 2008.\\nThree state agencies immediately responded and sent teams of senior staff members to remain \\non-site at NIU for several weeks in the aftermath of February 14. They rolled up their sleeves \\nand worked hundreds of hours alongside NIU staff to assist others in coping with the devastating \\nlosses. Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan and her staff provided support and information to the \\nvictims, their families and our faculty and staff in the wake of the shooting. The crime victim \\n\\nsupport and information. They helped coordinate federal and state resources for coping with \\nviolent crime, provided information on victim™s rights when dealing with media, and assisted \\n vii\\nstudents and families in completing crime victim compensation applications.

Within a few days of their arrival on campus, these IEMA staff \\n\\nwere considered part of our NIU community; we simply could not have functioned without  their help. Dr. Lorrie Rickman Jones, Director of the Division of Mental Health, Illinois Department of \\nHuman Services, traveled to NIU within 24 hours of the shooting and tasked Michael Pelletier, \\n\\nDHS/Division of Mental Health, to NIU for three weeks to assist NIU counseling staff and \\n\\nadministrators in creating counseling programs for students, faculty and staff; in reviewing \\n\\ncredentials of volunteer counselors; and in cutting bureaucratic red tape to ensure that victims \\nand their families received immediate and appropriate counseling services in their home \\ncommunities. We owe our gratitude to all who provided assistance and support during our darkest days. A \\nspecial debt of gratitude is due those NIU staff members who worked tirelessly in the days and \\n\\nweeks in the aftermath of February 14. They epitomize the best of NIU. \\n\\nall those individuals and institutions that provided support and assistance, the NIU community \\nhas come together as a family, stronger now than it was the day that tragedy struck our campus. \\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\n viii\\nIN MEMO\\nRIAM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFebruary 14, 2008 was the darkest day in the history of Northern Illinois \\n\\n\\nbefore them with untold promise. Twenty-one others were injured, some seriously. \\nTheir classmates in Cole Hall that day were shaken to their core and the entire \\ncampus was traumatized by an incomprehensible act of violence.\\nOur primary concern was for the victims and their families. We immediately \\nassigned staff to work with those most directly affected by the event. This effort \\n\\n\\nAs we began to examine the events of that day and our response to those events, \\nwe were assisted by reports assembled for the NIU Board of Trustees, by the State \\n\\nof Illinois Campus Security Task Force, the U.S. Fire Administration and internal \\n\\nanalyses from the Division of Student Affairs. \\nThe investigative summary contained in these pages prepared by the NIU \\nDepartment of Public Safety includes a timeline of events and a transcript of the \\n\\n\\nAs exhaustive as those reports were, a troubling question was left unaddressed: \\nWhy would a young man who had once been a successful student at NIU commit \\n\\nsuch a horrible crime? The sections on personal history and psychological \\n\\nevaluation explore that question, but many questions remain unanswered. \\nWe realize this report brings neither comfort nor closure, but by sharing what \\nwe learned while dealing with this tragedy, we add information to the body of \\n\\nresearch on mass shootings that seem to increasingly plague our society. \\nWhile this report reminds us all of our darkest hour, it also demonstrates the \\npower of a community pulling together in a time of tragedy. This collaborative \\n\\n\\n\\nthrough the myriad ways agencies and universities from across the nation came \\n\\nto our aid. And it was most touchingly evident in the strength and courage our \\n\\nstudents, families, faculty, staff, alumni, and community shared with one another.\\nWe will never forget February 14, 2008 and the terrible cost in human lives and \\nbright futures. The NIU community continues to recover and it is our hope this \\n\\nreport contributes to that healing process.\\nForward, Together Forward\\nJohn G.

After reviewing hundreds of interviews, phone records, e-mail correspondence and thousands of pages of evidence, what follows is the most recent, up-to-date report of the police investigation.  \\nDue to the nature of the ongoing investigation under certain statutes in Illinois, it is imperative \\n\\n\\nreleased without jeopardizing future potential investigative work. It is the goal of this report to review incidents prior to the shooting as well as in the aftermath, including: \\n until the days prior to the shootingcampus\\nSafety (NIUDPS), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \\nFirearms and Explosives (ATF), Illinois State Police (ISP), City of Sycamore Police \\n\\n\\n\\nof DeKalb Police Department (DPD), as well as other law enforcement agenciesvictims and NIU community members \\n\\n\\n\\n xvi\\nMAJO\\nR FINDINGS AND \\nRESPONSES\\n1) Kazmierczak had a history of poor mental health prior to his matriculation at NIU. It should be noted that institutions of higher education, including NIU, admit students on the basis of \\nacademic background and achievement. The admissions process involves no examination of a \\n\\nstudent™s medical or psychological background, since such an examination would be in violation \\n\\nof both Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. \\n\\nWhile Kazmierczak was at NIU, there are no records indicating that he had adverse contact with \\nthe local police, NIU police, or any judicial referrals. There would have been no reason for the \\n\\nuniversity to have known or suspected that Kazmierczak had mental health challenges.2) Shortly after beginning his graduate program at NIU, Kazmierczak perceived that the Sociology Department had undertaken a refocusing of its curriculum which led to a reduced \\nemphasis on criminology. This perception does not appear to have been accurate, as the Master \\n\\nof Arts (M.A.) program currently lists criminology as a specialization; a comparison of the \\n\\ncurrent and the 2006 Graduate Catalogs actually reveals an expansion of courses within the \\nspecialization. Kazmierczak™s perception may have contributed to a sense of abandonment. As a \\n\\nresult of his perception, Kazmierczak ultimately enrolled in the graduate program in sociology at \\nthe University of Illinois. 3) There were no warning signs that Kazmierczak was planning his attack. Kazmierczak was \\nvery good at blending into everyday life at NIU and was very private with his personal life. He \\nexcelled in academics and was a bright student who received accolades from professors.4) Northern Illinois University was uniquely prepared for emergency operations and response. \\n\\ninitiated steps to improve campus preparedness. Efforts were undertaken to strengthen the \\n\\n\\n\\nwith appropriate tools to effectively respond to emergency situations. By February 14, 2008, \\n\\nfor example, all of the NIU Public Safety personnel were EMT trained and included two \\n\\n\\n\\nassignments, responsibilities, protocols, and procedures to be undertaken in the event of such \\na crisis.

There is a variance in the times recorded by the \\n\\ndifferent responders during this even\\nt. The temporal intervals however are \\nconsistent and show no variation througho\\nut the term of the incident. The initial \\ntime that was provided for the incide\\nnt was given as approximately 1506:07 \\nhours, February 14, 2008. For purposes\\n of consistency and to minimize the \\npossibility for confusion, the previously stated time of 1506:07 hours will be used \\nas the official time for this report. Th\\ne source for time documentation is the \\nNorthern Illinois University Department\\n of Public Safety (NIUDPS) Computer \\nAided Dispatch and MediaWorks Voice Recorder.   \\nMuch of the emergency response activity\\n taking place during the event was not \\ncaptured on the MediaWorks Voice Recorder used to document incident \\nactivities. A significant amount of the communication was accomplished between \\nresponders face to face. Additional\\n communications were conducted via \\ntelephone, particularly discussions \\nbetween Chief Grady and NIU executive \\nadministrators. There was a great deal of discussion between NIUDPS other \\n\\ninitial law enforcement responders and \\nthe DeKalb Fire Department. None of \\nthese exchanges are captured on the NI\\nU telecommunication radio logs. There \\nare instances where activities are cited as\\n occurring at an approximate time that \\n\\nis not documented on the voice recorder time log. In these instances the \\n\\npersonnel involved verified the actions ta\\nking place and the approximate time of \\noccurrence.The Event\\nOn Thursday afternoon February 14, 2008\\n a Geology 104-Introduction to Ocean \\nSciences class was being held in Cole Hall \\nAuditorium 101, which is located on the \\nDeKalb Campus of Northern Illinois \\nUniversity. The auditorium has a total \\nseating capacity of 464. One hundred sixty-\\nfive (165) students were registered to \\ntake the class. A total of 120 students a\\nttended class that day. Two (2) students \\nleft class early and there was one (1) pers\\non visiting who was not registered.  \\nAt approximately 1505 hours, Steven\\n Phillip Kazmierczak entered that \\nauditorium and began shooting at th\\ne people occupying the room. At the conclusion of his attack, six (6) people \\nwere dead (including the shooter) and \\nanother twenty-one (21) had been wounded,\\n many of them seriously. The first 911 call advising the Northern Illinois Univer\\nsity Police Telecommunication Center of an active shooter at Cole Hall came in at approximately 1506 hours. Moments \\nlater, at approximately 1506:07, Northern Illinois University Department of \\nPublic Safety (NIUDPS) officers were alerted that there was ﬁa 911 call at Cole \\nHall saying there has been a shooting. . . \\n.ﬂ At approximately 1506:33, three (3) NIUDPS officers had responded and ﬁare in the area.ﬂ According to the radio log, \\n\\nat 1511:44 (approximately 5 minutes and 37 \\nseconds later) the NIU dispatcher is \\n 2NORTHERN ILLINOIS\\n UNI\\nVERSIT\\nY DEPA\\nRTMENT\\n OF PUBLIC\\n SAFET\\nY FE\\nBR\\nUA\\nRY 14, 2008 I\\nNVESTIGATI\\nVE SUMMA\\nRY\\nNORTHERN ILLINOIS\\n UNI\\nVERSIT\\nY DEPA\\nRTMENT\\n OF PUBLIC\\n SAFET\\nY FE\\nBR\\nUA\\nRY 14, 2008 I\\nNVESTIGATI\\nVE SUMMA\\nRY\\nnotified by Sergeant Ellington of the NIUDPS that the ﬁShooter™s down, shotgun™s \\nsecure, we need an ambulance and the coroner at Cole Hallﬂ (See Table 1).\\nSteven Kazmierczak entered the vestibule of Auditorium 101 in Cole Hall at the \\nextreme southwest corner of the room from behind the stage. The vestibule was \\n\\nconcealed by an unlocked metal door th\\nat opens to the left from inside the vestibule. Kazmierczak carried a black acoustic guitar case containing a 12 gauge \\nshotgun with a sawed-off barrel. He also\\n brought a black backpack, a partially \\nconsumed bottle of Gatorade, three (3) periodicals and miscellaneous other \\nitems. He left these items in the vestib\\nule with the exception of the shotgun. \\nKazmierczak wore a pair of dark brown b\\noots with laces, jeans, a black T-shirt \\nwith the word ﬁTerroristﬂ written across the chest imposed over a picture of an \\nassault rifle, a black knit hat and a bl\\nack utility belt with two (2) magazine holsters, a holster for a handgun, three handguns, eight (8) loaded magazines and \\na knife. Once he had donned his weapons he opened the door leading to the stage \\nwith such force the preponderance of people in the auditorium described his \\nentrance as ﬁkicking the door in.ﬂ\\nKazmierczak walked a short distance acro\\nss the stage and opened fire with the \\nshotgun directly into the audience. He \\nthen shot at the instructor, who was \\nstanding on the east side of the stage go\\ning over a test he™d given the class on \\nFebruary 12, 2008. The instructor tried \\nto run out of a door located at the \\nsoutheast corner of the auditorium at the rear of the stage. That door was locked. \\nThe professor then went off the front of the stage and ran down the east aisle to \\nthe rear exit on the east side of the bu\\nilding. The students were either running \\ntowards the north exits at the rear of \\nthe auditorium or attempting to hide \\nbetween the seats. The teaching assistant attempted to hide in the area of the \\nstage on the east end. After firing three (3) rounds, Kazmierczak began to reload. \\nSome of the students noticed the pause in the action and shouted, ﬁHe™s \\nreloading.ﬂ Students continued running wh\\nile some of them left their places of \\nhiding and started to run. Others either continued or attempted to hide between \\nthe seats or merely sat wh\\nere they were, apparently unable to respond to the \\ncrisis at hand.\\nOnce the shooter had expended all immediately available rounds from the \\nshotgun, he discarded it on the west end of the stage and began firing at the \\nroom™s occupants with a 9mm Glock semi-automatic pistol. Kazmierczak is \\n\\nreported to have walked up and down the west aisle and directly in front of or on \\n\\nthe stage, firing the weapon as he went. He\\n fired a total of six (6) rounds from the \\nshotgun and 50, 9mm rounds from the Glock. Two (2) fully loaded magazines \\n\\ncontaining rounds for a 380 semi-automatic \\npistol were found on the floor of the west aisle. It is not clear whether Kazmierczak merely dropped these magazines \\nor was attempting to reload the Glock \\nand fumbled with the wrong magazines. Fifty-five (55) unexpended rounds of ammu\\nnition were recovered from the scene.  \\n NORTHERN ILLINOIS\\n UNI\\nVERSIT\\nY DEPA\\nRTMENT\\n OF PUBLIC\\n SAFET\\nY FE\\nBR\\nUA\\nRY 14, 2008 I\\nNVESTIGATI\\nVE SUMMA\\nRY\\n3NORTHERN ILLINOIS\\n UNI\\nVERSIT\\nY DEPA\\nRTMENT\\n OF PUBLIC\\n SAFET\\nY FE\\nBR\\nUA\\nRY 14, 2008 I\\nNVESTIGATI\\nVE SUMMA\\nRY\\nTable 1. \\nNIUDPS Radio Traffic \\nFebruary 14, 2008 SOURCE: Computer Aided Dispatch & MediaWorks Voice RecorderRadio Traffic Text is not Verbatim \\nTime\\nSourceFromToRadio Traffic \\nLength of \\nRadioTraffic in \\nminutes \\n15:06:07RadioDenton \\nAll units \\nNorthern Units Northern\\n, I have a 911 call at \\nCole Hall saying there has been a shooting.

They encountered students running in \\nthe direction of Swen Parson Hall. A student yelled, ﬁHe™s shooting over thereﬂ \\nand pointed towards the Martin Luther King Commons (MLK) area. Officers \\nAyala and Zimberoff dropped off the person they were escorting and proceeded \\nimmediately west down the sidewalk \\nthrough the MLK Commons towards Cole \\nHall where they encountered students frantically running into their path, away \\nfrom the area of Cole Hall.  Unable to sa\\nfely proceed in their squad, they exited \\ntheir vehicle and proceeded to the northeas\\nt side of the bridge in front of Cole \\nHall, where the two (2) of them encounter\\ned students running from Cole Hall, \\nmany of them injured, some of them se\\nriously.

The student provided Officer Hodder with a description of the shooter, \\nwhich he then broadcast over the radio.\\n  Officer Hodder then proceeded to the \\nwest side of the MLK Commons where he parked his squad and witnessed the \\nsame frenzy of students running away from Cole Hall as did Officers Ayala and Zimberoff.  Officer Hodder attended to the needs of one of the students. He then \\n\\nstarted checking the area when he heard a call over the radio that the shooter was \\ndown.Sergeant Holland was on patrol at the time the call came in, and responded to the \\nincident from Annie Glidden Road and \\nLincoln Highway.

Sergeant Ellington was ahead \\nof Chief Grady and the lieutenants and \\ngot to Cole Hall before they did. He entered from the south side of the building. \\nSergeant Ellington entered the Jameson Auditorium on his left from the door \\nleading to the stage. He quickly cleared the room and exited into the area of the \\n\\nfront walkway. \\nLieutenant Henert was directed to establ\\nish inner and outer perimeters by Chief \\nGrady while they were approaching Cole Hall. Lieutenant Mitchell proceeded into \\nthe building with Chief Grady, where th\\ney met with Sergeant Holland, Sergeant \\nEllington, and Officer Wright in the inne\\nr walkway just outside the west entrance \\nto Auditorium 101. Sergeant Holland was \\ninstructed to remain in the hallway to ensure no one else entered and the shooter did not come out. Lieutenant \\n\\nMitchell, Sergeant Ellington, and Office\\nr Wright proceeded into auditorium 101 \\nin diamond formation with Chief Grady in the lead. \\nOnce inside, the team noticed a person ly\\ning motionless on the stage with several \\nweapons in close proximity. From all indi\\ncations he appeared to be the shooter. \\nThe person looked to have a large puddle of blood coming from beneath and \\naround the area of his head. A quick visual\\n search of the room revealed no other \\nimmediate threats. There were several peop\\nle with varying degrees of injury lying \\non the floor or propped against the seats. Chief Grady and Lieutenant Mitchell \\nbegan checking injuries, while Sergeant\\n Ellington and Officer Wright went \\ndirectly to where the shooter was laying and confirmed he was, in fact, dead. \\nSome of the injured were pulse less and \\nnot breathing. After careful examination of the injured several victims were dete\\nrmined to have deceased. The room was \\ndetermined to be safe and other officers \\nwere called to assist with the injured. Sergeant Rodman was in a meeting at the Holmes Student Center at the time the \\n\\ncall came in. He left the meeting, ran to\\n the ground floor, and was met by two \\nstudents. One of them was bleeding profusel\\ny from the back of his head and from his back. The other had blood covering his nose and mouth. The person bleeding \\n\\nfrom the head wound exclaimed, ﬁI™ve been shot!ﬂ while the other screamed, ﬁMy \\nfriend™s been shot; please help him!ﬂ Se\\nrgeant Rodman radioed in his location \\nand requested a paramedic. Officer Fillers\\n arrived and assisted Sergeant Rodman \\nin caring for the injured. Sergeant \\nEllington called for additional medical \\nassistance and an EMT bag. Sergeant Ro\\ndman proceeded to Cole Hall where he \\nretrieved an EMT bag, entered Cole Hall, and began working on the wounded. At \\nChief Grady™s request, Sergeant Ellingto\\nn radioed for Officer Fillers to come to \\nCole Hall once her patient was stable so that she could start IVs. \\nIt is estimated that from the time Kazmierczak started shooting until the time he \\nwas reported ﬁdownﬂ and the auditorium \\ndeclared safe was approximately six (6) \\nto six and one-half (6 ½) minutes. NIUDPS personnel were the first officers on-scene and the only officers to enter Cole\\n Hall Auditorium 101 in response to the \\nactive shooter call.

All law enforcement agencies selected as ﬁleadﬂ for various \\nassignments were designated for reasons of \\nexpediency, efficiency and their potential \\nfor effectiveness. Each was identified based \\nupon the scope of the particular operation, \\navailable personnel, equipment, specific ex\\npertise, and familiarity with the specific \\narea of assignment. The completeness, thoroughness, and accuracy of the initial \\n\\ninvestigations lay with the assigned lead agency.  All follow-up investigations are the \\nresponsibility of NIUDPS. \\nLead Agency Assignments and Responsibilities \\nNorthern Illinois University \\nDepartment of Public Safety \\nThe Northern Illinois University Departme\\nnt of Public Safety (NIUDPS) was the \\nprimary response agency during the February 14, 2008 shooting. NIUDPS maintained \\n\\nresponsibility for all investigative initiative\\ns following the incident and all subsequent \\nfollow-up investigation activiti\\nes. Several law enforcement agencies were given specific \\nresponsibilities as the functional ﬁleadﬂ fo\\nr investigative assignments in the aftermath \\nof the shooting. The lead agency for any part\\nicular function was entirely responsible for \\nthe execution of that assignment and was eith\\ner directly or indirectly involved in the \\nidentification, collection, and preservation of\\n evidence, witness identification, location \\nand interview and/or the collection and preservation of other case-sensitive \\ninformation relative to their area of respon\\nsibility. Additionally, agencies assigned as \\nthe ﬁleadﬂ for any particular function \\nwere responsible for summarizing their \\ninvestigative findings and providing all information and evidence they collected to \\nNIUDPS for review. NIUDPS was then respon\\nsible for acceptance of the materials and \\neither suggesting the lead agency investig\\nate further or NIUDPS conducted follow-up \\ninvestigations as they deemed necessary\\n and appropriate. NIUDPS continued to \\nreceive information and evidence, determined to be critical to the investigation, from \\nsupporting agencies through the date of this writing. A private psychologist was used to develo\\np a comprehensive psychological profile of \\nSteven Kazmierczak in an attempt to provide insight into the shooter™s possible \\n\\nmotivation and to identify likely contributing\\n factors or circumstances. A sergeant from \\nthe NIUDPS was assigned to assist the psyc\\nhologist in making contact with potential interviewees, obtaining necessary reports or\\n other documents, and securing warrants or subpoenas for school or military records and psychological evaluations or medical \\n\\nrecords as requested by the psychologist. \\nThe psychological analysis conducted by th\\ne FBI Behavioral Sciences Unit was not available to the NIU Department of Public Safety until September of 2009. NIUDPS \\nhad previously begun reviewing all reports and documents associated with the \\nincident. A number of investigative issues \\nrequiring additional scrutiny have been \\nidentified and follow-up procedures continue. High profile cases of this magnitude, \\n\\nregardless of the investigative effort, tend to leave many lingering unanswered \\n\\nquestions. There are salient indicators that one or more people may have been in very \\n\\nclose contact with Steven Kazmierczak on or\\n just prior to February 14, 2008.

However, there are a number of questions and/or concerns that remain; \\nquestions such as, were there any other people aware of Steven Kazmierczak™s plan? If \\nthere were, what was the extent of their knowledge or involvement? What was his \\nmotive? Why did Kazmierczak choose NIU? Wh\\ny did he choose Cole Hall? Why did he \\nuse birdshot instead of 00-buck or slugs in \\nthe shotgun? Where are the hard drive from \\nhis computer and the SIM card from his tele\\nphone? This is but a sampling of the \\nquestions that remain. Therefore, as it is wi\\nth other similar high profile cases of this \\nmagnitude and complexity, the investigatio\\nn continues until the NIU Department of Public Safety is confident that every possible question has been answered to its \\n\\nsatisfaction and that everything that could be done, has been. There are issues of \\nconsequence having significant implications for this case that may never be resolved. \\nConsequently, closure for the survivors of the shooting, their families, the families of \\nthe victims, and the University community may never be fully realized.           \\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) \\n\\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) wa\\ns assigned as the lead agency for crime \\nscene processing, evidence collection, and \\nbehavioral analysis and motivation.

The \\n\\nBAU-1 conducted a review of the attack and an evaluation of Steven Kazmierczak, \\nfocusing on specific behaviors exhibited \\nprior to and during the incident. The FBI \\nanalysis included an offender history. Th\\ne BAU-1 examined parallels between the NIU \\nshooter and other school shooters as well as providing insights into possible motivations. All references to offender \\nmotivation made by the FBI BAU-1 were necessarily speculative, as there were no letters, videos, or manifestos left by the \\n\\nshooter providing an explanation or rationale for the attack. The FBI BAU-1 completed \\ntwo (2) on-site consultations involving NI\\nUDPS and the City of DeKalb Police \\nDepartment. The FBI™s BAU-1 conducted a work\\nshop in March of 2009 to review and discuss the preliminary findings of \\nthe FBI™s Behavioral Sciences Unit. \\nDuring the month of March, 2009, the Nort\\nhern Illinois University Department of \\nPublic Safety sought the assistance of a clinical psychologist who could review the \\n\\ninformation and evidence related to the Fe\\nbruary 14, 2008 shooting involving Steven \\nP. Kazmierczak. This person was to evaluate Steven Kazmierczak™s psychological \\nhistory and his background to develop a comprehensive psychological profile of him as \\nthe shooter, related specifically to his a\\nttack on the NIU campus. The psychologist \\nevaluated all information and records regard\\ning Steven Kazmierczak and conducted all \\ninterviews separately from the FBI BAU-1 in \\nan effort to find any possible motive or \\nrationale for Kazmierczak™s behavior on Febr\\nuary 14, 2008. All references to offender \\nmotivation made by the independent ps\\nychological consultant were necessarily \\nspeculative, as there were no letters, videos\\n, or manifestos left by the shooter providing \\nan explanation or rationale for the attack.\\nSteven Kazmierczak \\nPersonal History and Background \\nAnecdotal Observations\\n\\nSteven Kazmierczak was described in vast\\nly different ways dependent upon the relationship he had with the person describing him. Some\\n of his professors at NIU \\ntypically described him as being polite, consc\\nientious, helpful, likeable, social, and even \\nsweet. Others, however, described him as in\\ntroverted, doubting, insecure, mistrustful, \\nquite, and secretive. Kazmierczak™s elementary and high school teachers referred to \\n\\nhim as being an underachieving, impulsive person who lacked motivation and required \\n\\nstructure.

Me\\nntal health professionals used words like \\nanxious,depressed\\n,obsessional,angry,paranoid\\n,suicidal\\n, and \\nschizophrenic to \\ndescribe him.\\nThe investigating psychologist observed that ﬁAn understanding of the true nature of \\nSteven Kazmierczak must reconcile both\\n the complexity and contradiction that \\ncharacterized this troubled young man.ﬂ He went on to assert that, as an adult, Steven \\nKazmierczak was able to disguise his pu\\nblic persona rather well. Kazmierczak \\ndeliberately concealed information regarding his past, withheld indications of \\n\\ninappropriate thoughts or impulses, even fr\\nom his closest friends, and always wore \\nlong-sleeved shirts. The latter was presumably to hide his tattoos. He also concealed \\nhis mental health background. Primary and Secondary School\\nOn August 26, 1980 at 2157 hours Steven P.\\n Kazmierczak was born to Robert and Gail Kazmierczak of Elk Grove Village in Hoffman \\nEstates, Illinois. Steven attended Sauk \\nCreek Elementary School and Elk Grove Vi\\nllage Junior High School. During these \\nyears he was described as moti\\nvationally inconsistent, disruptive, and otherwise having \\nbehaved inappropriately. It has been repo\\nrted that Steven was an underachiever throughout his primary and secondary school \\nyears. Some of his teachers reported \\nhaving suspicions he may have had a lear\\nning disability or an attention deficit \\nproblem. Steven was described as appearing to have difficulties concentrating. \\nAdditionally, he was reported as having \\na negative attitude, and as behaviorally \\ncareless and impulsive. These conditions were \\nseen as complicating his ability to learn. \\nAt least one instructor believed Steven™s early writings contained themes of violence \\n\\nand found them to be inappropriate. There is anecdotal evidence that Steven was \\n\\nbullied during his early school years. Like\\nwise, there are reports that he picked on \\nothers during this same peri\\nod.  His family sought an evaluation of Steven through \\nschool officials, but their request was deni\\ned. Steven Kazmierczak was enrolled in Elk \\nGrove High School in 1994.  He graduated \\nin 1998. There he met Joe Russo and they \\nbecame close friends. Joe and Steven remained friends and stayed in contact with one \\nanother until Steven™s death.Familial Relationships   \\nSteven had an older sister, Susan. His sister was generally viewed as being more compliant, better behaved, and more successful\\n academically than her brother. Steven and Susan didn™t get along and developed an intense sibling rivalry which evolved into \\na lifelong enmity. Susan claims Steven was a significant source of chaos and confusion \\n\\nin the home. She recounted a time when Steven\\n was in the eighth grade that he became angry, grabbed a knife, and forced her to \\nrun from the house to avoid injury. Susan generally felt threatened by Steven. When in\\nterviewed by the police after the shooting, \\nSusan said she was surprised he hadn™t come \\nto kill her. Their relationship had always \\nbeen conflicted and remained so until Steven\\n™s death.

He was reported to have been a stable employee, and he was pr\\nesent in the home. It has been suggested that Mr. Kazmierczak may have been relatively\\n uninvolved in the affairs of the family \\nor with regards to personal interactions with\\n Steven. Steven visited his father in Florida \\nwith his girl friend, Jessica Baty, and lifelo\\nng friend Joe Russo in November, 2007. His father reportedly told Steven his mother\\n had in fact rejected him and remained \\nunwilling to forgive him for the disruption\\n he™d caused within the family as an \\nadolescent. During this visit, Steven was provided with his entire adolescent \\n\\npsychiatric history. Additional inform\\nation regarding Robert Kazmierczak™s \\nrelationship with his son at the time of this writing was limited.Steven™s mother worked as a secretary. \\nShe was present in the home during his \\nupbringing. It is reported that Steven and \\nhis mother, during his early years, spent a great deal of time watching horror movies\\n. The themes and images contained in the \\nmovies were said to be grossly violent and \\nmacabre and of questionable suitability for a \\nchild of Steven™s age at the time. Steven™s re\\nlationship with his moth\\ner is said to have \\nbeen openly conflicted and confrontational duri\\nng his adolescent years. Steven™s sister \\nSusan reported that her brother was verbal\\nly abusive towards their mother. According \\nto Susan, Steven often called his mother a ﬁwhore, slut and a bitch.ﬂ Susan believes \\nSteven blamed his mother for his instituti\\nonalization in the various mental health facilities. Gail Kazmierczak died in Sept\\nember, 2006 of ALS. The conflict and bad \\nfeelings that existed between Steven \\nand his mother were never resolved. Record of Police Contact\\n\\nSteven only had a couple of minor contacts \\nwith the Elk Grove Village Police. He and \\nJoe Russo were detained on February 6, \\n1994 for reckless conduct. They placed a \\nﬁDrano bombﬂ on the porch of a neighbor. Steven was 13 and Joe was 14 at the time. \\nThere was no damage to property and no one was injured. The incident was handled \\nthrough what Elk Grove Village Police referr\\ned to as ﬁstation adjusted.ﬂ No charges \\nwere filed.

However, someone discover\\ned Steven had falsified his application to \\ngain entry into the army by failing to reveal\\n his history of treatment for mental health \\nissues. Army personnel discovered he had an extensive mental health record including \\n\\nmultiple attempts to commit suicide. Kazmie\\nrczak was placed in an army hospital and \\nunderwent a comprehensive psychiatric eval\\nuation by U.S. Army mental health professionals. Subsequently, he was released\\n from his military commitment. His last \\nduty assignment was with Ch\\narlie (C) Battery (BTRY), 1\\nst Battalion (BN), 56\\nth\\nAir\\nDefense Artillery (ADA), 6\\nth Brigade (BDG) Training Company (TC). Kazmierczak was \\nseparated from the army for fraudulent \\nentry and was given an uncharacterized \\ndischarge. He departed the army from Fort \\nBliss, Texas 79916-6812 on February 13, \\n\\n2002.

He also \\nworked at a Marathon gas station from around April 2002 to somewhere around June \\n2003. He enrolled at NIU in August of 2002 and began his coursework in the fall of \\nthat year. Steven struggled during the first couple of terms at Northern. He lived in the \\nresidence halls, had a roommate, and was considered ﬁstrangeﬂ or ﬁweirdﬂ by some of \\nhis peers. Later he focused intently on his coursework and began to isolate himself. \\nSteven spent the majority of his time studyi\\nng and preparing for his classes and exams. \\nHe has been described as having been \\nﬁexceedingly conscientious and compulsive \\nabout his work.ﬂ He was an avid reader. When not occupied with schoolwork, Steven \\namused himself by watching movies and playing video games. He was particularly fond \\nof violent or gruesome horror movies and extremely violent video games.\\nSteven learned to function exceedingly well \\nduring his stay at Northern Illinois \\nUniversity. He concealed his quirks and soci\\nally damning qualities and kept mostly to himself. His friendships were compartmentali\\nzed. There was very little crossover in his \\nrelationships. His friends generally did not know each other, with limited exceptions. \\nSteven™s friendships were with individuals,\\n and his interactions with others didn™t \\ninclude socializing in groups. He adjusted we\\nll to the structure and organization of the \\neducational environment at NIU. It has been \\nsuggested that, from Steven™s perspective, there may have been significant parallels between NIU and the army. They provided \\n\\nsimilar attractions, including structure, clear expectations, regular meals, and \\n\\nacceptable living quarters.\\nSteven Kazmierczak became well respected as a student, as a teaching assistant, and as \\na colleague. Kazmierczak graduated in May, 2006 and was awarded a Bachelor of Arts \\n\\ndegree.

The diagnosis \\nof Schizo-Affective Disorder, although\\n somewhat uncommon and not typically \\n\\nassociated with adolescence, denotes a serious \\nmental illness. It describes an individual \\nwhose mental condition is affected by a ve\\nry problematic combination of significant \\ndepression and thought disorder. It is char\\nacterized by thought disturbance that has \\nreached psychotic proportions, challenging \\nthe individual\\'s ability to distinguish \\n\\nbetween ideas and experiences that are reality based from those that are rooted in \\nfantasy.\\nKazmierczak™s partial medical records from the group home, including the periodic \\nnotes of the treating psychiatrist who follo\\nwed him throughout his entire stay, confirm \\nthe presence of ongoing paranoid ideation\\n, frequent complaints by Kazmierczak of \\nﬁvoicesﬂ commenting on his (Kazmierczak\\'s\\n) inadequacies and the occurrence of at \\nleast one ﬁepisode of visual hallucinationﬂ while in the program.  \\nA second integral aspect of Schizo-Affective \\nDisorder is the presence of significant \\nmood disturbance. This disturbance is \\nusually expressed in the form of major \\ndepressive episodes but can also be present in a bipolar pattern that includes both \\ndepression and mania. The majority if not a\\nll of Kazmierczak™s hospitalizations appear \\nto have been directly related to suicidal \\nbehaviors and attempts, clear evidence of his \\nseriously depressed mood.  \\n\\nFurther confirmation of the seriousness of\\n Kazmierczak™s psychiatric condition is \\nfound in the fact that he was treated with \\nseveral major tranquilizers or antipsychotic \\nmedications including Seroquel, Risperdal,\\n Clozaril and Zyprexa. These are used \\nalmost exclusively to treat psychiatric agit\\nation and the presence of schizophrenic and psychotic conditions.\\nOn July 26th, 2000 Kazmierczak™s psychiatri\\nst indicates the following in his notes: \\nﬁvoices continuing, anger and paranoia.ﬂ Ka\\nzmierczak complains that the antipsychotic \\nSeroquel is not working and says he has an unrelenting compulsion to ﬁcheck doors \\nand touch objects repeatedly.ﬂ This symptom \\nis worse over the past three weeks. The psychiatrist describes him as ﬁdysphonic,ﬂ with some suicidal thoughts, and indicates \\nthat Kazmierczak is having ﬁtrouble opening \\nup because he doesn\\'t think it will help.ﬂ \\nThe stated diagnosis is, ﬁSchizo-Affective Disorder, not improved.ﬂ  \\nThere is little doubt that for a significant peri\\nod of time between the ages of sixteen and \\ntwenty-one, prior to his enrollment as a studen\\nt at Northern Illinois University, Steven \\nKazmierczak suffered from a major mental illn\\ness. Even if one were to question the diagnosis of Schizo-Affective Disorder, a second diagnostic likelihood would have to be \\nconsidered: Major Depression \\nwith Psychosis. This condition essentially reverses the \\norder of Kazmierczak™s most serious sympto\\nms. With this diagnosis the presence of \\ndepressed mood and a markedly diminished in\\nterest or pleasure in all or almost all \\nactivities exists most of the day, nearly every day. Insomnia or hypersomnia is also \\n NORTHERN ILLINOIS\\n UNI\\nVERSIT\\nY DEPA\\nRTMENT\\n OF PUBLIC\\n SAFET\\nY FE\\nBR\\nUA\\nRY 14, 2008 I\\nNVESTIGATI\\nVE SUMMA\\nRY\\n31NORTHERN ILLINOIS\\n UNI\\nVERSIT\\nY DEPA\\nRTMENT\\n OF PUBLIC\\n SAFET\\nY FE\\nBR\\nUA\\nRY 14, 2008 I\\nNVESTIGATI\\nVE SUMMA\\nRY\\npresent nearly every day. Fatigue or loss \\nof energy, feelings of worthlessness or \\nexcessive guilt, and self-reproach and the diminished ability to think and concentrate \\noccur. Recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are also \\nhallmarks of this condition. In addition, some form of psychosis is involved. The \\nepisodes of depression are characterize\\nd by hallucinatory experiences, thought \\ndisturbance, and other psychotic symptoms of the type reported by Kazmierczak and his psychiatrist.\\nFrom the psychiatric history available at the time of this report, it is unclear whether \\nthe medications that were prescribed for Kazmierczak were helpful to him. In fact, \\nthere are some indications that they may ha\\nve been harmful. He gained an inordinate \\namount of weight, going from his normal 160-170 pounds to 300 pounds or more at \\n\\none point. Kazmierczak often reported f\\neeling drugged and unable to muster any \\nenergy or interest. For the last five to six \\nmonths in his program at Thresholds, before \\nbeing discharged into the community \\nessentially on his own recognizance, \\nKazmierczak failed to comply with the medication program prescribed for him. He \\nweaned himself from the medications but did not tell his psychiatri\\nst. He was able to \\nfool the staff for five or six months before\\n confessing his actions after being scheduled \\nfor blood work that would have detected \\nhis noncompliance. By this time, he had \\nbegun to lose the weight the medications apparently caused and his mind seems to \\n\\nhave started to clear. His me\\nntal illness appears to have begun to slowly remit.\\nUnfortunately for Kazmierczak and others\\n with such problems, remission from psychiatric conditions like Schizo-Affectiv\\ne Disorder or Major Depression with \\nPsychosis does not mean cure. Rather, without reconciliation of the problems that led \\n\\nto the conditions or realignment of the brai\\nn chemistry that might have contributed to their cause, reoccurrence is almost inevitable. \\nThe individual is most at risk for a return \\nof the disturbance at a later time, especially at\\n the point of another life transition or in \\nresponse to an event or series of events \\nthat again challenge the individual™s mental \\nand emotional integrity. \\nA treatment summary note from the Thresholds program proved prophetic for \\nKazmierczak™s future:\\nﬁWhen symptomatic, he (Kazmierczak)\\n becomes anxious, depressed and \\nunable to sleep. Increased suicidal thou\\nghts (occur) and (he) feels worthless \\nwith low self-confidence and self-esteem.\\n (He) Can become verbally aggressive \\nand argumentative. (Has) A hi\\nstory of self-mutilation.ﬂ  \\nThis same symptom picture in addition to his previously demonstrated compulsive \\nchecking and excessive hand-washing woul\\nd precipitate his next contact with a psychiatrist, this one at the McKinley Health \\nCenter at the University of Illinois in the \\nfall of 2007, just a few months before hi\\ns return to NIU on Valentine™s Day 2008.  \\nBecause of his deceptive behavior and ov\\nerall noncompliance with his treatment, \\nKazmierczak was discharged from the group \\nhome. He was referred to another mental \\nhealth treatment program without the close \\nsupervision and residential requirements \\nof Thresholds. This program wa\\ns characterized by help with\\n living and working in the community and developing independent livi\\nng and personal improvement skills.

He failed at several retail-based and fast food part-time jobs. He continued to \\n\\ndemonstrate random aggressiveness and ex\\nperienced problems living cooperatively \\nwith others. While he attended some self-help groups and had access to treatment \\ncoordinators who sought to supervise his acti\\nvities and provide help with plans for his \\nfuture, Kazmierczak appeared to be directionless.\\nWithout comprehensive records from this prog\\nram, we have no way of knowing how he \\nactually fared. However, his overall mo\\ntivation remained inconsistent and his \\nsuccesses appear to have been minimal. Ther\\ne is no indication of any regular family \\ncontact. There is also no evidence that he ev\\ner returned to live at home. At some point, \\nKazmierczak made a decision to join the Army\\n. He appears to have been interested in \\nthe educational benefits available to him as \\na soldier. Prior to his enlistment he had \\ntried a few college-level classes \\nbut without any notable success.  \\nFor a brief while, Kazmierczak appeared to \\nhave found a home in the Army. Later, he would tell others that if allowed \\nto he could have spent the rest\\n of his life in the service, perhaps drawn to the structure and security \\nit offered. He had little trouble completing \\nbasic training. He tells his friends that the \\nArmy trained him to kill people and valued \\nrecruits who did not become upset or emotio\\nnal in response to such training. He \\nassured them this had been no problem for him.\\nAbout the time he was settling in for a long-term enlistment, it was discovered that \\nKazmierczak had enrolled in the Armed Serv\\nices under fraudulent circumstances by \\nfailing to acknowledge his past psychiat\\nric history, his need for psychotropic medications and his multiple hospitalizations\\n for suicidal behavior. He was suspended \\nfrom his duties, placed in the hospital fo\\nr safekeeping and a comprehensive psychiatric \\nevaluation ordered. Unfortunately, a formal re\\nport of the findings is never released by \\nthe Army. Eventually Kazmierc\\nzak is given an uncharacterized discharge and dropped \\noff in his home town of Elk Grove Village, Illino\\nis. It is not clear if he went home at that \\ntime or even visited with his family. Stev\\nen Kazmierczak was out of the Army, out of \\nwork and seemingly out of luck.Kazmierczak had little to show for the first twenty-one years of his life. He had failed \\nwith his family, and felt unloved and unacceptable to them. He had failed in the world \\nof work, having been unable to hold numero\\nus low-level jobs. None\\n were full-time, and \\nhe worked at some only a week or two. He had failed as a soldier and been banned \\nfrom a career in the military. Perhaps worst of all, he had become a failure in his own \\n\\neyes, and continued to struggle with persistent\\n feelings of depression and hopelessness. \\nFive years of serious psychiatric disturbanc\\ne had left him with little self-confidence and \\nvery low self-esteem. But, his \\nmind was regaining greater clarity with each passing day, \\nand his ability to process thought and comprehend ideas at a high level of abstraction \\nhad reemerged. Language arts had always be\\nen his strong point. Reading and writing \\ncame easy for him.

These prob\\nlems took the form of a series of inner conflicts and contradictions that included:  \\nA deep need for love and acceptance but an intense fear of rejection and \\nabandonment interfering with his ability \\nto trust others and blocking his ability \\nto adequately express anger and resentment.  \\nA strong desire to prove himself compe\\ntent and to achieve academic success, \\nhampered by a serious lack of confidence and a deep sense of personal \\n\\ninadequacy.  \\nA wish to put family problems and fail\\nures behind him, despite unresolved \\nfeelings of hurt and hostility toward his parents and sister and a desire to avenge \\nthe wrongs that he felt were done to him.A plan to pursue personal goals and future objectives in the midst of nagging \\nquestions about the meaning and purpose of life.\\nA need for structure and direction fueled by a fear of loss of control.\\nAn expressed empathy toward the downtr\\nodden, especially those he perceived \\nas having suffered like himself, opposed \\n by  a judgmental intolerance toward those be thought to be over-privileged \\nand/or less intelligent or capable than \\nhimself.\\nKazmierczak appears to have responded positi\\nvely to the organization and consistency \\ninherent in his college experience. A place to\\n stay, regular meals, clear expectations and \\ndaily requirements provided helpful struct\\nure. He became exceedingly conscientious \\nand compulsive about his work, avoiding the necessity for a social life. He spent almost \\n\\nall his time preparing ahead of time for cl\\nasses, papers and exams. Spare time was \\ndevoted to playing video games, watching\\n movies and reading. He masked his \\nvulnerabilities and shortcomings, seeking to hide his most unacceptable qualities and \\n\\nthe damaging history of his yo\\nuth. He kept mostly to hi\\nmself, but ran afoul of his \\nroommate and a few other dorm associates\\n who quickly picked up on his quirky \\nbehavior, self-imposed isolation and his obse\\nssional preoccupation \\nwith serial killers \\nand murderous psychopaths, both past and pr\\nesent. ﬁStrange Steveﬂ and ﬁPsychoﬂ were \\ntwo of the nicknames they hung on him.However, as the school year progressed, \\nKazmierczak began to get his college legs \\nunder him. As he did, his confidence in\\ncreased and his inappropriate behavior \\ndeclined. He began to feel comfortable in th\\nis new life and to plan. His first tentative career goals which had focused on computer science now began to take another \\n\\ndirection, in great part because of his \\nencounter with a respected and charismatic professor who taught in the Department of Sociology.\\nKazmierczak made a good impression. In\\nstructors found him ﬁvery motivated,ﬂ ﬁresponsive to suggestionsﬂ and ﬁinteresting \\nto talk with.ﬂ He was described as ﬁa \\nperson who will bring credit to the program and the profession.ﬂ One member of the \\n\\nSociology Department summed it up in this way:  \\n 34NORTHERN ILLINOIS\\n UNI\\nVERSIT\\nY DEPA\\nRTMENT\\n OF PUBLIC\\n SAFET\\nY FE\\nBR\\nUA\\nRY 14, 2008 I\\nNVESTIGATI\\nVE SUMMA\\nRY\\nNORTHERN ILLINOIS\\n UNI\\nVERSIT\\nY DEPA\\nRTMENT\\n OF PUBLIC\\n SAFET\\nY FE\\nBR\\nUA\\nRY 14, 2008 I\\nNVESTIGATI\\nVE SUMMA\\nRY\\nﬁHe was exceptional as a student, one of\\n those who was defi\\nnitely a standout. \\nHe was every professor™s and advisor™\\ns dream come true, a very respectful \\nstudent who was polite and so dedi\\ncated and conscientious. Nobody had anything bad to say about him.ﬂWithin the Sociology Department, Kazmie\\nrczak found an affirming and supportive \\nenvironment. Psychologists know that pe\\nople change when their circumstances change. They can construct new lives for th\\nemselves. Often the key factor in this \\npersonal reconstruction is the development of a strong relationship with a competent \\nand caring person.\\nKazmierczak™s association with this particul\\nar professor (Professor-1) appears to have \\nbeen just such a renewing relationship. \\nThe close working relationship the two had \\neventually resulted in their becoming good fr\\niends. In his mentoring and befriending of \\nKazmierczak, the professor appears to serve \\nas the patriarch of a new family grouping \\nin which Kazmierczak almost immediately assumed the role of favored son, a \\npositioning another Sociology Department \\nmember described as ﬁunprecedented for \\nan undergraduate.ﬂ\\nProfessor-1™s letter of support for Kazmierczak™s admission to the Graduate School at \\nNorthern Illinois University a few years late\\nr was effusive in its praise of Kazmierczak™s abilities as a student. Because it sums up\\n Kazmierczak™s highly successful performance \\nas an undergraduate and demonstrates the \\nposition of prominence he had achieved \\n\\nwithin the Department of Sociology family, I \\nquote it extensively. Professor-1 writes:  \\nﬁI have known Steve since he enrolled in\\n my introductory sociology class about \\nthree years ago. He quickly impressed me\\n as a hard-working student, far more \\nmature and intellectually curious than ev\\nen advanced graduate students. Steve \\nwas not only an A student: he quickly st\\nood out as one of the top students, and \\nin a class of about three hundred and sixt\\ny-five students, this was not easy. . . . \\nHe always did far more work than requi\\nred, exhibited considerable initiative \\nin pursuing additional material and wa\\ns obviously highly motivated and self-\\ndirected.

Beca\\nuse of Steve™s maturity and intellectual \\nacumen I asked him, even though an un\\ndergraduate, to be a team leader.

Because Steve is a hard worker and \\neasily exploited, I immediately sought \\nhis assistance as a paid, undergradua\\nte teaching assistant for a large \\nSociology 170 class (370 students), an\\nd he agreed. Although I could have had \\nmy choice from any of our graduate students as my two TAs, I chose Steve and \\none other graduate student, because I felt\\n that Steve was on\\ne of the two best \\npeople for the tasks.

He is an avid \\nreader, extremely articulate, incisively \\nanalytical and quick thinking. He is the \\ntype of student who could, even now, \\nteach his own class. I support him enthusiastically both for admission to the \\n\\ngraduate program and for genero\\nus financial assistance.ﬂ\\nIn Professor-1, Kazmierczak had found a personal champion, who valued his \\ncontributions and seemed to care about him \\nin a way that no one else ever had. \\nPerhaps for the first time, Kazmierczak began \\nto believe that he was truly acceptable \\nand loved by the people who were important to him. Maybe life had meaning and \\npurpose after all.\\nUndergraduate Academic Advisor-2 in the De\\npartment of Sociology also had frequent \\ncontact with Kazmierczak during his underg\\nraduate years. He came to her office \\nliterally hundreds of times over a three-and-\\na-half year period, ostensibly to check his \\nschedule, get help with decisions about cl\\nasses and discuss his choice of degree programs. She says he would always ask, ﬁCan \\nyou just verify this?ﬂ, ﬁI just wanted to \\ncheck,ﬂ ﬁI think I™m right.ﬂ To Advisor-2, it seemed that what Kazmierczak really \\nwanted most from her was the personal contact and reassurance that he was on the \\nright track, doing things the right way. ﬁValidation, recognition and acceptanceﬂ \\nseemed to be what he needed. ﬁPraise, praise\\n, praise,ﬂ she said, seemed to be what he \\ncraved. Like Professor-1, she t\\noo saw Kazmierczak™s potential. ﬁHe was the star in our de\\npartment, the Golden Child.\\n We all knew that one day he would go on to get his Master™s and his Ph.D. at\\n prestigious universities, \\nbecome a great success, and make us all proud.ﬂ\\nWithin this emotionally healing and suppo\\nrtive ﬁfamilyﬂ environment, Kazmierczak \\nflourished. The superior potential that had been frustrated and hidden began to \\n\\nemerge. Successes and honors began to accumulate. His life was better than it ever had \\n\\nbeen. In four short years, from his enrollm\\nent at Northern Illinois University as a freshman in August of 2002 to his acceptan\\nce into the graduate program in Sociology \\nat Northern Illinois University in the summ\\ner of 2006, Kazmierczak had risen from the \\nashes of his emotional disturbance and early \\nfailures to the heights of personal and academic success and the promise of a succe\\nssful professional career and personal future. 36NORTHERN ILLINOIS\\n UNI\\nVERSIT\\nY DEPA\\nRTMENT\\n OF PUBLIC\\n SAFET\\nY FE\\nBR\\nUA\\nRY 14, 2008 I\\nNVESTIGATI\\nVE SUMMA\\nRY\\nNORTHERN ILLINOIS\\n UNI\\nVERSIT\\nY DEPA\\nRTMENT\\n OF PUBLIC\\n SAFET\\nY FE\\nBR\\nUA\\nRY 14, 2008 I\\nNVESTIGATI\\nVE SUMMA\\nRY\\nHowever, with the death of his biological mother from ALS in September of 2006, \\nKazmierczak\\'s life would again start to reverse itself.

These events triggered the \\nreturn of his earlier psychiatric symptoms, \\nincluding anxiety, depression, insomnia, obsessive- compulsive checking and \\n\\ndisturbances in his thinking.  \\nThese losses included the following:\\nHis mother™s death without any resolution of the conflict that existed between \\nthem and that had resulted in their estrangement (September 2006).  \\nThe loss of his graduate program in Sociology at Northern Illinois University \\nand the security and stability that its familiar people, places and professors \\nprovided (Fall 2006 -Spring 2007).\\nThe loss of his second family, the Sociol\\nogy Department at Northern Illinois \\nUniversity, and the father figure and mentor who had befriended him (Spring \\n2007).The loss of love and intimacy associated with the deterioration and subsequent \\nbreakup of his relationship with his girlfr\\niend around the time of their move to \\nChampaign/Urbana and the University of Illinois (September 2007).  \\nThe loss of personal security and well-be\\ning associated with moving to a new \\ncity, a new home, a new school, and a ne\\nw graduate program (September 2007). \\nThe loss of a sense of equilibrium and em\\notional control when his debilitating \\npsychiatric symptoms return and directly threaten his success as an individual \\nand as a new graduate student at the Un\\niversity of Illinois (August/September \\n2007).The loss of his position of prominence and respect within the Northern Illinois \\nUniversity Department of Sociology and \\nwith other students, professors and his \\nmentor associated with his self-imposed\\n (?) banishment from the department™s \\nweb board seminar (Fall 2007).\\nThe loss of a valued job as a correctional officer (October 2007).\\nThe loss of personal integrity, self-esteem and self-worth as he reads his entire \\npsychiatric record from the past, and is required to acknowledge, perhaps for \\nthe first time, the nature and severity of\\n his mental illness and his specific \\npsychiatric diagnosis (November 2007).\\n NORTHERN ILLINOIS\\n UNI\\nVERSIT\\nY DEPA\\nRTMENT\\n OF PUBLIC\\n SAFET\\nY FE\\nBR\\nUA\\nRY 14, 2008 I\\nNVESTIGATI\\nVE SUMMA\\nRY\\n37NORTHERN ILLINOIS\\n UNI\\nVERSIT\\nY DEPA\\nRTMENT\\n OF PUBLIC\\n SAFET\\nY FE\\nBR\\nUA\\nRY 14, 2008 I\\nNVESTIGATI\\nVE SUMMA\\nRY\\nThe loss of self-worth as he faces uneq\\nuivocal confirmation from his father of \\nhis mother™s rejection of him and her re\\nfusal to forgive him for the trouble he caused his family as an adolescent (November 2007).  \\nThese multiple, emotionally debilitating \\nlosses crushed Kazmierczak™s fragile self-concept and eventually sent him reeling \\ntoward a destructive end. The polite, \\nconscientious, academic achieving and altruistic wanabee who wished to help others \\novercome their personal demons was no longer\\n able to keep his own under control. The \\nrage that he felt toward self and others for \\nhis life and his losses moved to the forefront \\nof his consciousness.

Anxiety increased,\\n anger and aggression returned, and inner \\nvoices began again to plot and condemn.\\nWhy did Kazmierczak target Northern Illinois University? \\nWith this information as background we re\\nvisit the question of why Kazmierczak chose \\nNorthern Illinois University and Cole Hall as\\n the focus of his attack. While we do not \\nhave a complete picture of Kazmierczak™s ea\\nrly family life and emotional experience, we do know that considerable conflict ex\\nisted between him and both his mother and his sister. Anger and hostility were expresse\\nd in some form by all. Kazmierczak was estranged from his family of origin and had only sporadic contact with them. In an e-\\nmail dated October 27, 2007 to a woma\\nn he met online, Kazmierczak wrote, ﬁ . . . I mentioned [sic] family when I talk\\n to others and say that they are doing \\nfine but the truth is I really\\n don™t have much of a family. My justification is that \\nI do not want to ever let people know th\\nis about me so that \\nthey do not think I \\nam strange. It™s rare that I even see members of my family.ﬂWe know that Kazmierczak was deeply rese\\nntful toward his parents for having made \\nﬁthe heartbreaking decisionﬂ to remove him fr\\nom the family at age seventeen and place \\nhim in a group home. It appears he was also angry and hurt because he was never allowed to return home. We know that he \\nran away from the program on numerous \\noccasions and tried to return to his family but was always refused reentry to his home \\nand repeatedly returned to the program by his parents. \\nKazmierczak had found a ﬁnewﬂ and initially more accepting and supportive family \\nwithin the Department of Sociology at Nort\\nhern Illinois Universi\\nty. This new family \\nwas a community of students and professors \\nthat not only accepted him as a member but highly valued his unique contribution and \\nrole. It was a place where he finally fit in. \\nHe sensed that the people there cared about him and loved him. He met instructors \\n\\nwho nurtured and supported him. One in particular befriended him, mentored him, \\nand cared about him much in the way a good father does a son.\\nWithin this new family, Kazmierczak also \\nfound a relationship with a young woman \\n(his girlfriend, Jessica Baty) that became intimate and enduring. Patient and \\nsupportive, she allowed his eccentricities, tolerated his problem behavior and seemed \\n\\nto love him in spite of them. With this \\nsurrogate family/support system in place, \\nKazmierczak™s life had begun to improve dr\\namatically.

This appears to have begun \\nwith the short-circuiting of his graduate program at Nort\\nhern Illinois University.\\nWhile Kazmierczak had been admitted to the graduate program in Sociology at \\nNorthern Illinois University with classes be\\nginning in September of 2006, just prior to or shortly after the beginning of his firs\\nt academic semester, the Department of \\nSociology apparently began to change. A fu\\nll understanding of what happened is still \\nnot clear and needs additional clarification. Some of Kazmierczak™s e-mails and \\n\\nwritings indicate that the Sociology De\\npartment was being taken in a different \\ndirection by new leadership.\\nﬁ . . . [I] pursued an MA in Criminol\\nogy [at NIU], but found the program was \\nbeing scaled back due to a new depart\\nment head who was somewhat hostile \\ntoward Criminology and who wanted \\nthe graduate program to focus on \\ngender and racial inequality . . . \\nnot my proverbial cup of tea.ﬂ\\nThe classes Kazmierczak needed to complet\\ne his desired degree and that would be \\nrelevant to his career path were no longer \\navailable. If he were to receive a graduate \\ndegree in Social Work/Criminology it woul\\nd not be granted at Northern Illinois University. Kazmierczak sought the assistance\\n of his mentor/friend in the Department \\nof Sociology and was encouraged to apply to the Master™s in Social Work program at \\n\\nthe University of Illinois in Champaign/Urba\\nna. He would have to start over at a new \\nschool, in a new place, with new students \\nand new professors. He would have to leave \\nthe security and safety of the Sociology Department and his substitute family. He \\n\\nwould have to move out.  \\nA second serious blow was struck when Kazmierczak™s favorite-son status was \\nthreatened by his own anger and questionable\\n actions. He was apparently chastised by \\nhis mentor for venting in an unprofe\\nssional and inappropriate manner on the \\nSociology Department™s web board discussion \\nsite. He was either prohibited from any \\nfuture participation by his mentor or in hi\\ns humiliation offered to withdraw from \\nfurther involvement online himself. In eith\\ner case, his status in the ﬁfamilyﬂ and his \\nposition in the eyes of his peers were greatly diminished. His involvement in the \\ndepartment was brought to an end. Only \\na few businesslike e-mails to his revered \\nmentor characterize his communications with \\nhis surrogate family in the fall of 2007.  \\nProfessor-1 confirmed the familial nature of \\nhis experience in relation to Kazmierczak \\nand other students in the Sociology Departme\\nnt, in  a personal coda at the end of a \\npaper he wrote about Kazmierczak and the events of February 14, 2008.

In \\naddition to his possible anger and rese\\nntment toward the Sociology Department, \\nKazmierczak in the same e-mail mentioned ab\\nove also touches on his attitudes toward some of his fellow students:  \\nﬁOk, so you want to know the truth abou\\nt graduate school? At NIU for my first \\nyear of graduate school I was a teaching assistant for statis\\ntics (with a focus \\non sociologic research methods) and al\\nthough I liked my teaching assistant \\nposition (i.e. grading, working one-on-one with students, teaching the occasional class), I absolutely did not \\nenjoy the graduate program. This was \\nmainly due to the lack of quality students. I am far from arrogant and consider \\nmy self-humble, but some of my fellow students there were not there for \\nanything besides a piece of paper and always complained about assignments, \\n\\nthe ample readings, etc., which really annoyed me.ﬂ\\nKazmierczak made comments to family members and several others concerning his \\ncontempt for certain students at Northern Illinois University, particularly those he \\nthought didn™t appreciate the privileges they\\n had been given. Kazmierczak™s father told police that Kazmierczak ﬁoften said students\\n at NIU were over-privilegedﬂ and there were ﬁa lot of well-to-do and uppity people\\n there.ﬂ Kazmierczak™s godfather also told \\nthe police that on several occasions Kazm\\nierczak had made similar comments about \\nsome of his classmates at Northern and that ﬁit bothered Steven.ﬂ\\nWhat is clear in all of this\\n is that Kazmierczak was very\\n conflicted about the members of both his families. He felt rejected and abandoned by his family of origin and \\nharbored great resentment and anger toward \\nhis mother and sister. At the same time, \\nhe wanted their love and approval. He carried these feelings with him to Northern \\nIllinois University and they were ultimately displaced into the Department of Sociology \\nand the people in it who constituted his se\\ncond family. Kazmierczak hid the degree to \\nwhich he felt this anger and resentment, much\\n like he hid the important details of his \\nearly life, his psychiatric history and his ta\\nttoos from those around him. He may have \\neven hidden it from himself in his unconsc\\nious mind through the psychological process \\nof repression. Tragically, it could not stay \\nhidden forever and when it finally emerged, it proved to be uncontrollable and incredibly punitive.\\n\\nConsidering this scenario, one might reasonab\\nly ask, ﬁIf Kazmierczak were turning his \\nmurderous rage and resentment onto his fa\\nmilies, both original and surrogate, why \\ndidn\\'t he seek out and attack specific peop\\nle at Northern Illinois University who he \\nknew and with whom he had been involved?ﬂ One can speculate that although \\nKazmierczak may have had a partial or semi-\\nconscious awareness that he was angry at his Northern Illinois University family in \\nthe same way that he \\nwas angry at his actual family members, the greater part of his awareness would probably have been \\nunconscious. As a result, specific targeting of\\n individuals as representative of his true \\nfamily members would not have likely occurred.  \\n 40NORTHERN ILLINOIS\\n UNI\\nVERSIT\\nY DEPA\\nRTMENT\\n OF PUBLIC\\n SAFET\\nY FE\\nBR\\nUA\\nRY 14, 2008 I\\nNVESTIGATI\\nVE SUMMA\\nRY\\nNORTHERN ILLINOIS\\n UNI\\nVERSIT\\nY DEPA\\nRTMENT\\n OF PUBLIC\\n SAFET\\nY FE\\nBR\\nUA\\nRY 14, 2008 I\\nNVESTIGATI\\nVE SUMMA\\nRY\\nOne might also ask, ﬁIf Kazmierczak™s ange\\nr and rage toward his family of origin \\nexisted in conscious awareness, why didn™t he try to attack and kill them?ﬂ Again, the \\nfull answer to the question is not clear. However, his mother had already died and his \\nfather, who is reported to have been the pe\\nrson he was closest to\\n in his family, was \\nliving in Florida. Kazmierczak™s sister, to\\nward whom he had been much more hostile \\nand direct in the expression of his feelings, is reported to have been living in \\nChampaign/Urbana at the time of the shooting. Why didn™t he target her? It is \\ninteresting to note that his sister had, in \\nfact, felt quite threatened by her brother and \\nwas specifically worried about his anger towa\\nrd her. In her interview with the police following the shooting, Susan Kazmierczak said\\n she was ﬁsurprised that he didn™t come to kill me.ﬂSusan Kazmierczak also reported that at the time of her brother™s initial breakdown, he \\nhad been verbally abusive toward their moth\\ner, ﬁcalling her a whore, slut and bitch.ﬂ \\nShe says that Steven was placed in Thre\\nsholds because he was uncontrollable and \\nﬁcausing chaosﬂ at home. Susa\\nn also recalls an incident when Kazmierczak was in the \\neighth grade and ﬁpicked up a knife and chas\\ned me,ﬂ requiring her to run out of the \\n\\nhouse to get away from him. These examples\\n indicate that Kazmierczak™s anger toward \\nhis mother and sister may we\\nll have reached murderous proportions in the past and had previously resulted in a possible \\nattempt to actually kill his sister.Despite Professor-1™s published comments th\\nat cite several sociology students as \\nvictims of the shooting, the investigation of\\n Kazmierczak™s possible relationship to any \\nof the students in Cole Hall on February 14th\\n , 2008 did not reveal that he  knew or \\nwas aware of the specific identity of his vict\\nims or that he singled out specific students to shoot. However, in the context of viewin\\ng his crime as an attack on family, the \\nstudents who were present would symbolically\\n represent siblings rather than parents. In addition, we know from Kazmierczak™s \\ncomments to others about his disdain for some of the students at NIU this would have \\nprobably resulted in additional motivation \\nfor the primary focus of the attack to be directed at students.\\nWhy did Kazmierczak target Cole Hall? \\n\\nIf, in fact, it™s true that Kazmierczak had \\nbecome angry at his surrogate family in the \\nsame way that he was angry at his family of\\n origin, why does the attack take place at \\nCole Hall rather than somewhere else on campus?\\nCole Hall was the birthplace of a new beginni\\nng for Kazmierczak. His first classes in \\nsociology were convened there and the office\\ns for the Sociology Department where he \\nwould spend much of his time as a student were right next door in Zulauf Hall. If the \\nNorthern Illinois University Campus at la\\nrge was home ground, Cole and Zulauf were \\nKazmierczak™s backyard. By ending his life \\nand the lives of other siblings (students) \\nthere, Kazmierczak would have come full circle\\n. It was where he had flourished. Now it \\nwould be the setting for his grotesque end.\\nKazmierczak was also familiar with the layout\\n of the room both from the standpoint of \\nstudent and teacher. The classes were typica\\nlly large, sometimes constituting hundreds \\nof students, and the stage was a dramatic\\n location for him to enact his final \\npsychodrama. It™s hard to imagine what \\nhis thoughts may have been as he stood \\noutside that door at Cole, his back to the Sociology Department and all that had been \\n NORTHERN ILLINOIS\\n UNI\\nVERSIT\\nY DEPA\\nRTMENT\\n OF PUBLIC\\n SAFET\\nY FE\\nBR\\nUA\\nRY 14, 2008 I\\nNVESTIGATI\\nVE SUMMA\\nRY\\n41NORTHERN ILLINOIS\\n UNI\\nVERSIT\\nY DEPA\\nRTMENT\\n OF PUBLIC\\n SAFET\\nY FE\\nBR\\nUA\\nRY 14, 2008 I\\nNVESTIGATI\\nVE SUMMA\\nRY\\ngood in his life at Northern Illinois Univ\\nersity and his face toward the nightmarish \\ndestruction he was about to unleash inside.  \\nWhy did Kazmierczak carry out his attack on Valentine™s Day? \\nThe last question this report addresses is\\n why Kazmierczak planned and carried out his murderous actions on Valentine™s Day. What \\ndoes it mean that a young man, who had \\nalways felt abandoned, rejected and unlo\\nved by others, chooses a day set aside to \\nrecognize and celebrate Love, for a mass killing?  \\nThe month of February does appear to have had some significance for Kazmierczak. He \\ntook his first class at Northern Illinois University in Cole Hall in February, 2003. \\nWhether or not this was on or close to Febr\\nuary 14th is not known. He was discharged \\nfrom the Army on February 13th and returned home to Elk Grove Village on February \\n14, frustrated and upset that he had not been allowed to remain in the service. \\nFebruary 14, 2007 was also the initial exam\\n date for a correctional officer™s position \\nwhich Kazmierczak had greatly valued. His girl\\nfriend said this position was extremely \\nimportant to him and his failure to experi\\nence success on that particular job was a \\ngreat personal disappointment to him. Vale\\nntine™s Day may have been an upsetting ﬁanniversaryﬂ for him as a result.There are also indications that Kazmierczak™\\ns choice of this special day to commit his \\ncrime may have been associated with his n\\need to be remembered and glorified for his \\nactions. Albert Borowitz, author of \\nTerrorism for Self-Glorification: The Herostratos \\nSyndrome, defines the expression of the Herostratic impulse as\\nﬁa drive to maximize the (person™s) se\\nnse of power. The criminal feels an \\nenhancement of power in the form of self-glorificati\\non (the achievement of \\nname recognition) or self-aggrandizement (a demonstratio\\nn of capacity for destruction) through accomplishment of\\n a flaunting act which will live in \\ninfamy.ﬂFor Kazmierczak, committing a crime of this \\ntype on Valentine™s Day may have been a way of insuring that his actions and his memo\\nry in the minds of the general public and \\nhis NIU family would not be ea\\nsily forgotten. We know that he idolized mass murders \\nand perpetrators of other horrendous crimes\\n. Perhaps he envisioned his own act as Valentine™s Day Massacre II, a day that would \\nlive in infamy for the Northern Illinois \\nUniversity community as well as secure hi\\ns enshrinement in the Destroyer™s Hall of \\nShame. He would be remembered by those at Northern Illinois University as that \\nﬁshining starﬂ in the Sociology Department who had plummeted from his place in the \\nheavens of academic success to the very dept\\nhs of notorious disgrace. But, he would \\nnot be forgotten.\\nBorowitz also points out that  \\nﬁa feeling of loneliness, alienation, me\\ndiocrity and failure may trigger anger \\nand envy directed against those perceive\\nd to be more successf\\nul or prestigious. \\nIndividuals with this need for notoriety and fame sometime\\ns combine it with \\nother motives, personal or ideological, \\nin taking criminal action.

Such a day may \\nhave represented all that he refused to believ\\ne in and all that he wished to repudiate. \\nHis behavior on Love™s Day may have been an attempt to reverse the Christian dictum \\nand proclaim, ﬁhate is stronger than love,ﬂ ﬁdarkness is stronger than light,ﬂ and prove \\nthat ﬁevil triumphs over good.ﬂ Valentine™\\ns Day, Steven Kazmierczak style, may have \\nbeen his way of giving love and life hi\\ns final finger. ﬁFTWﬂ was the tattoo he had \\nsported on his left middle finger. The initials stood for ﬁFuck the World.ﬂ \\nPark Dietz, a forensic psychologist, when\\n speaking of John Hinckley, Jr. said \\nsomething that seems to apply to\\n Steven Kazmierczak as well:  \\nﬁ. . . That™s a terrible combination, being suicidal and wanting revenge. That™s \\nat the heart of most of the workplac\\ne and school mass murders of the last \\ntwenty years.ﬂ  \\nNevertheless, one of Kazmierczak™s final acts \\nappears to stand in contradiction to some \\nof these formulations. In his last few days\\n before the act, waiting alone in DeKalb, \\nKazmierczak went online and purchased a seri\\nes of gifts, including a special ring, for \\nJessica Baty. He sent all of these gifts to her over the next few days with the following \\nnote:ﬁYou are the best Jessica! You™ve done so \\nmuch for me and I truly do Love [sic]. \\nYou will make an excellent psychologist or social worker some day! Do not \\nforget about me! Love, Steve.ﬂ  \\nKazmierczak™s Preoccupation with Violence and Death \\nA Bible verse from the Book of Proverbs (Chapter 4:23, NIV) urges,\\nﬁAbove all else, guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life.ﬂ \\nThere is little to indicate that Steven Kazm\\nierczak was willing to heed or would have \\nallowed himself to believe such wisdom.\\nThroughout his lifetime, Steven Kazmierczak \\nwas never able to shake his obsessional \\ninterest in violence, destruction, murder, and the macabre. Wherever he happened to \\nfind it, whether in video games, films, book\\ns about serial killers, Hitler, reports of new \\nhorrors on the nightly news, Columbine, Jeffery Dahmer or Virginia Tech, it all \\nfascinated him and he could never seem to \\nget enough. Perhaps it had been bred into him, the operative switch first turned on du\\nring those long afternoons as a child at \\nhome with his mother in front of the TV, the disturbing actions and ghoulish details on \\nthe screen burning deep into his boyhood brain.While he was given instruction in the Christ\\nian faith and the Catholic Church  by his \\nparents, and, as reported by \\nhis sister, was apparently requ\\nired to attend weekly Mass, \\nKazmierczak rebelled against this and stopped go\\ning in his early teens. In his first year \\n NORTHERN ILLINOIS\\n UNI\\nVERSIT\\nY DEPA\\nRTMENT\\n OF PUBLIC\\n SAFET\\nY FE\\nBR\\nUA\\nRY 14, 2008 I\\nNVESTIGATI\\nVE SUMMA\\nRY\\n43NORTHERN ILLINOIS\\n UNI\\nVERSIT\\nY DEPA\\nRTMENT\\n OF PUBLIC\\n SAFET\\nY FE\\nBR\\nUA\\nRY 14, 2008 I\\nNVESTIGATI\\nVE SUMMA\\nRY\\nor so of high school, he declared himself an\\n atheist and continued to identify himself in this manner throughout his life.  \\nThere is some evidence to suggest that at \\nthe end of his life, Kazmierczak was openly \\npursuing a full refutation of his religious background by adopting tenets of the Satanic \\nChurch. He was said to be a reading the writ\\ning of the Satanist, Anton LaVey. In one of \\nhis last acts before the shooting, he ha\\nd the Devil™s pentagram tattooed on his left \\nshoulder, perhaps as an exclamation point to the presence of several human skulls \\nalready engraved on other parts of his body. This last tattoo was added in January of \\n\\n2008. The subsequent malevolent destructions a month later and his own suicide \\n\\ncould have been full and final acts of defian\\nce directed at a religious faith that had \\nsought to teach him the sanc\\ntity of all human life.  \\nKazmierczak often spoke of his favorite\\n video games and movies, especially \\nSaw and \\nSaw IV\\n,Mr. Brooks\\n, and \\nFight Club\\n. All four and others he periodically praised are \\nmovies that highlight violent and murderous themes.The liner notes from one of the early \\nSaw movies explain the plot of the film in the \\nfollowing manner:\\nﬁObsessed with teaching hi\\ns victims the value of life, a deranged, sadistic, \\nserial killer abducts the \\nmorally wayward. Once captured, they must face impossible choices in a horri\\nfic game of survival. The vi\\nctims must fight to win \\ntheir lives back, or di\\ne trying . . . .ﬂ\\nIn the movie itself, a newspaper headli\\nne concerning recent murders proclaims, \\nﬁPsychopath teaches sick life lessonsﬂ (to peop\\nle who do not appreciate their blessings). Jigsaw picks people who have demonstrat\\ned a disregard for life, done something \\nwrong, taken advantage of others or who are not using their talents and potential as \\nthey should. He then puts them to the test\\n (often a choice between physical harm to \\nthemselves in exchange for their lives or the \\nlife of another) to force them to see their \\nown mistakes and to better appreciate their lives.  \\nIt appears to be more than coincidence that\\n on Halloween of 2007, four months before \\nentering Cole Hall to begin hi\\ns killing spree, Kazmierczak dressed up in full mask and \\ncostume as the puppet that represents the ch\\naracter Jigsaw. He sent the picture of \\nhimself in this bizarre array to a number\\n of people. Kazmierczak may have already \\nbegun to see himself as a wrathful, revenge\\nful deliverer appointed as puppet god, to \\nteach a lesson to wrongdoers\\n. Or, was he, like Jigsaw, im\\nposing his own malevolent \\ngame on his unfortunate victims: ﬁHow will \\nyou react?ﬂ ﬁWill you do\\n anything to save \\nyourself or save another?ﬂ Some crime scene witnesses indicated that when \\nKazmierczak had emptied the shotgun and wa\\nlked down into the audience with his \\n\\nhandguns he shot only at those running out \\nof the room or trying to hide under their \\nseats rather than those who remained frozen \\nin their chairs. If this was true and had \\nbeen planned by him, one can only speculate what ﬁgameﬂ Kazmierczak may have been \\nchallenging his victims to play.\\n 44NORTHERN ILLINOIS\\n UNI\\nVERSIT\\nY DEPA\\nRTMENT\\n OF PUBLIC\\n SAFET\\nY FE\\nBR\\nUA\\nRY 14, 2008 I\\nNVESTIGATI\\nVE SUMMA\\nRY\\nNORTHERN ILLINOIS\\n UNI\\nVERSIT\\nY DEPA\\nRTMENT\\n OF PUBLIC\\n SAFET\\nY FE\\nBR\\nUA\\nRY 14, 2008 I\\nNVESTIGATI\\nVE SUMMA\\nRY\\nThe movies \\nFight Club\\n and \\nMr. Brooks\\n also appear to reflect personality issues that are \\ncentral to understanding Steven Kazmierczak and his distorted perspectives about \\nviolence. They may offer insight into Ka\\nzmierczak™s own attitudes and beliefs.\\nInFight Club\\n, the protagonist, played by the actor Edward Norton, is introduced to the \\nFight Club (also called Project Mayhem) by Tyler, a character who at the end of the \\nmovie is revealed as Norton™s alter ego. Tyle\\nr presents the Fight Club philosophy, a life \\nperspective that encourages men in particular to challenge convention and express \\nanger and rage directly toward others thro\\nugh physical violence as a way of feeling \\nbetter and living clearer.\\nThe following quotes taken from the movie \\nare articulated by Tyler. They may well have influenced Kazmierczak™s distorted perspectives:  \\nﬁReject the basic assumptions of societyﬂ\\n; ﬁStop trying to control everything \\nand just let goﬂ; ﬁIt™s only after we have\\n lost everything that\\n we are free to do \\nanythingﬂ; ﬁWe are God™s unwanted chi\\nldrenﬂ; ﬁWe are the \\nmiddle children of \\nhistory, (with) no purpose, no place and we™re very, very pissed offﬂ; ﬁWe\\'re \\nnot killing anyone, we™re setting them free.ﬂ  \\nThe movie \\nMr. Brooks\\n echoes similar themes, the thrill \\nof killing and the glorification \\nof murder as both obsession and release. \\nIn reference to the violence he commits \\ntoward others, serial killer Mr. Brooks, says, ﬁI\\n do this because I™m addicted to it.ﬂ He \\nexplains further that he never murders impu\\nlsively but only as the result of a well-\\nthought-out plan, ﬁbecause (otherwise) we wouldn™t be in control and we could leave \\nloose ends.ﬂ Mr. Brooks also remarks, ﬁBefore I was the thumbprint killer I killed a lot \\n\\nof (other) people in a lot of different waysﬂ and maintains that ﬁanyone who is good at \\nwhat they do wants credit.ﬂ  \\nPerhaps the most chilling aspect of this movie is that the same dual personality device \\nemployed in \\nFight Club\\n is used to represent the serial\\n killer and his actions. We are shown an alter ego or evil presence for \\nMr. Brooks who encourages and prompts him to \\nmurder. This inner malicious persona leads Brooks to act out his murderous ideas and \\nthen watches from behind as the violent crimes are committed. This mental state may have approximated Kazmierczak™s paranoid\\n mindset during adolescence and perhaps \\nagain at the end of his life. His early experi\\nence with delusional thinking and previous \\nacknowledgement of a voice that continually plagued his conscious mind suggest \\nKazmierczak may have been directed or influenced by a voice or alter ego \\n\\ncommunicating with him, and urging him to kill.\\nKazmierczak as a ﬁPsychotic Shooterﬂ \\nIn a recently published book, Peter Langma\\nn, Ph.D. developed a typology for the ten \\nschool shooters he studied, including Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold at Columbine and \\nSueng Hui Cho at Virginia Tech. Langman di\\nvided the ten mass killers/school shooters \\nhe studied into three basic categories: Psyc\\nhopathic Shooters, Psychotic Shooters, and \\nTraumatized Shooters. Although\\n Kazmierczak is not included in Langman™s research, it \\nis obvious that he would be categorized \\nas a Psychotic Shooter if he had been.\\n NORTHERN ILLINOIS\\n UNI\\nVERSIT\\nY DEPA\\nRTMENT\\n OF PUBLIC\\n SAFET\\nY FE\\nBR\\nUA\\nRY 14, 2008 I\\nNVESTIGATI\\nVE SUMMA\\nRY\\n45NORTHERN ILLINOIS\\n UNI\\nVERSIT\\nY DEPA\\nRTMENT\\n OF PUBLIC\\n SAFET\\nY FE\\nBR\\nUA\\nRY 14, 2008 I\\nNVESTIGATI\\nVE SUMMA\\nRY\\nEssential for inclusion in the Psychotic Shooter category is a diagnosis of schizophrenia \\nor evidence of some other form of psycho\\nsis. While Langman correctly indicates that ﬁSchizophrenics are no more prone to violen\\nce than the general population,ﬂ he finds \\nthat several factors are characteristic of th\\ne schizophrenics in this Psychotic Shooter \\npopulation: they show a strong tendency to \\nbe male, they show a lack of compliance in \\ntaking antipsychotic medicati\\non, and younger schizophrenics are more likely to be \\nviolent than older ones. Substance abuse is also found to contribute to violence in this \\npopulation, although there are no indication\\ns whatsoever that substance abuse, either \\nbefore or during the shooting, was involved in Kazmierczak™s actions.  \\nLangman also ﬁfound other influences at workﬂ in this group. An important influence was the structure of the shooter™s family. A\\nll five Psychotic Shooters were found to be \\nthe youngest in their families. ﬁAll had higher\\n functioning siblings, some of whom were \\nhigh achieving, stars.ﬂ He also found that Psychotic Shooters had significant conflict \\nwith their parents. In addition, ﬁinfamousﬂ\\n people seem to have influenced this \\ncategory of shooters more than the others \\nhave. Kazmierczak™s profile matches all of \\nthese factors.\\nThe Psychotic Shooters also exhibited extr\\neme reactivity and what Langman calls \\nﬁexistential rage.ﬂ He explains,  \\nﬁThese were young men who were raging against the conditions of their \\nexistence. They were not just angry with\\n a person or a group of people. They \\nwere angry at life, angry at\\n the world. . . . it was \\nrage against a world that \\nwas unfair and incomprehensible. The Ps\\nychotic Shooters realized they were \\nmisfits. They could not measure up to th\\neir siblings who were normal and in \\nsome cases outstanding individuals. Th\\neir parents were disappointed in them \\nand argued about how to treat them. They struggled socially and felt isolated. \\nThey raged against the cruelty of fate th\\nat they were born impaired and could \\nnever be like other people.ﬂ  \\nLangman sees the concept of existential \\nrage as instrumental both in shooters \\ncommitting murder as well as a driving fo\\nrce in their own suicidal thinking and \\nbehavior. He states that it is not surpri\\nsing to have found that all the Psychotic \\nShooters in his study were suicidal, becaus\\ne ﬁThey had all suffered significant distress for years.ﬂ All had social deficits, psychotic symptoms and hi\\nstories of suicidal thinking \\nand behavior.\\nKazmierczak and Existentialism \\nLike many contemporary college students, St\\neven Kazmierczak gravitated toward the \\ntenets and beliefs of existential philosophy. \\nHe was particularly interested in the ideas \\nof Friedrich Nietzsche and was reading \\nThe Antichrist\\n in the last few months of his life. \\nSo enamored was he of this book that he sent\\n a copy of it to his girlfriend just prior to \\nthe shooting.\\nNietzsche™s brand of existentialism actively \\nadvances the idea that ﬁGod is deadﬂ and \\nthe notion that personal existence demand\\ns struggle and confrontation.

Moreover, these nobles have contempt for non-individuals (slaves), name\\ns he assigns to those who do not act \\nindependent of societal rules or seek change and strive for power.\\nThere are indications that Kazmierczak, in\\n his last few weeks \\nand months, may have \\nbeen trying to reinvent himself along Nietzs\\nchean lines. It is not difficult to see how \\nsuch ideas might influence a mind already \\nat risk and could have been used by \\nKazmierczak to justify his feelings of contemp\\nt toward those students he judged to be \\ninadequate or unacceptable at Northern Illinois University. At the end, Kazmierczak \\nmay well have succumbed to hopelessness and despair and embraced a nihilistic \\ndestruction of himself and others.  \\nSummary and Conclusions \\nSteven Kazmierczak was an extremely complex and deeply troubled young man. He \\n\\nhad a history of serious mental illness, whic\\nh first manifested itself during adolescence \\nin the form of schizophrenia and major depression. He experienced frequent and \\n\\nsevere suicidal ideation and his thinking \\nhad sometimes been paranoid and delusional \\nin nature. He was preoccupied with themes, images and ideas of violence and \\n\\ndestructive behavior toward ot\\nhers for most of his life.Kazmierczak had long harbored suppressed feelings of anger and resentment toward \\nhis own family members, particularly his mo\\nther and sister. Over time, unresolved and \\nrepressed anger becomes crippling and unpredictable for the individual. Kazmierczak \\n\\nfelt abandoned and rejected by his parents \\nand blamed them for his removal from his \\nhome and placement in a residential treatment program at the age of seventeen. He \\nheld his family accountable for his mostly\\n unhappy life and frequent failures and \\ndisappointments. Kazmierczak™s unfortunate \\ncombination of serious mental illness, \\nextensive fantasy preoccupation and unre\\nsolved family conflicts combined to significantly increase his potential for destru\\nctive behavior at some point in his life.\\nFor four years, while an undergraduate student at Northern Illinois University, \\nKazmierczak appears to have been in remiss\\nion from the most serious aspects of his \\npsychiatric condition. This remission, along \\nwith his superior in\\ntellectual ability and \\nstrong determination to prove himself, allo\\nwed Kazmierczak to reach a high degree of academic success. Not the least of the reason\\ns for this success was his acceptance into a \\nnew family on the campus of Northern Illinois University and within the Sociology \\nDepartment. The support and encouragement he received as a valued and important \\n\\nmember of this new family allowed him, for a time, to put aside the feelings of anger, \\nabandonment and personal worthlessness th\\nat he had suffered from throughout his life.However, beginning in the fall of 2006, Kazmierczak™s personal adjustment and life functioning again began to deteriorate. This \\ndeterioration was precipitated by a series \\nof severe losses and personal crises th\\nat eroded his newfound confidence and \\nemotional control. Two of these losses were \\nparamount in his personal downturn. The \\nfirst involved the changes he encountered in \\nhis graduate program at Northern Illinois \\nUniversity and his transfer to a second gradua\\nte program at the University of Illinois, \\n NORTHERN ILLINOIS\\n UNI\\nVERSIT\\nY DEPA\\nRTMENT\\n OF PUBLIC\\n SAFET\\nY FE\\nBR\\nUA\\nRY 14, 2008 I\\nNVESTIGATI\\nVE SUMMA\\nRY\\n47NORTHERN ILLINOIS\\n UNI\\nVERSIT\\nY DEPA\\nRTMENT\\n OF PUBLIC\\n SAFET\\nY FE\\nBR\\nUA\\nRY 14, 2008 I\\nNVESTIGATI\\nVE SUMMA\\nRY\\nChampaign/Urbana. With the ﬁlossﬂ of his \\ngraduate program at Northern Illinois \\nUniversity, the personal security, near- unconditional acceptance and high level of \\nacademic success he had enjoyed were now \\ngone. Gone too, was the close personal \\nrelationship with his mentor and friend, Professor-1. Because his experience with his \\nNIU ﬁfamilyﬂ closely paralleled the family con\\nflicts of his youth, the repressed anger \\nand rage he had felt toward his family of origin began to resurface.  \\nA second event of significant magnitude for \\nKazmierczak was the severe loss of self-\\nesteem and personal integrity he undoub\\ntedly suffered upon reading the detailed psychiatric records from his numerous \\npsychiatric hospitalizations and other \\ntreatment programs five to six years pr\\nior. Kazmierczak was confronted with the \\ndebilitating nature of his schizophrenic con\\ndition, a condition he probably had not \\nunderstood at the time and that he ha\\nd tried to deny and suppress since his \\nhospitalizations.\\nAs Kazmierczak™s mental stability started to waiver, he began to act in more reckless \\nand self-destructive ways. Buying guns \\nand ammunition, soliciting prostitutes and \\nsexual contact with both men and women on\\n the Internet, purchasing tattoos with bizarre and violent content, acting in a pa\\nranoid and secretive manner, and pursuing \\nan interest in satanic ritual and practice all \\noccurred in the last few months before that \\nfinal day in February.\\nAs his depression and thought disturbance \\nreappeared and worsened, they became a \\nfertile ground for Kazmierczak™s suspicions, inappropriate ideas and secret plans to \\nseek revenge against those people and insti\\ntutions he felt had victimized him. At the \\nsame time, his long-standing obsession with\\n serial killers and mass murders offered numerous examples as to how his own rage \\nmight be expressed.

The teams focus on matters of immediate crisis, disturbing behavior, and medical and \\n\\npsychiatric situations regarding individuals in the campus community. These teams are charged \\n\\nwith collecting appropriate information regarding individuals who have brought attention to \\nthemselves through their actions or threatening behaviors. The teams seek to assess the level of \\n\\nthreat and decide upon and implement an action plan for intervention and follow-up. In cases of \\n\\nPublic Safety.\\nTo ensure that the team is able to gather a wide range of information, utilize diverse knowledge \\nand skill bases, and view the situations from multiple perspectives, each team is comprised of \\nmultiple units from across the university.

Since the crisis, the CSDC has secured funding for and \\nhired two additional psychologists. Both of the new staff members have experience in providing \\n\\ntreatment in the areas of grief, trauma, and loss. Additionally, one of the new psychologists has \\n\\nprevious work experience in a Veteran™s Affairs Hospital. This staff member™s clinical experience \\n\\nand training in working with military veterans is pivotal as we support this growing population \\non the NIU campus.The closure of the behavioral mental health unit at Kishwaukee Community Hospital in October 2009 has had an impact on the services that CSDC provides to NIU students. In the absence of \\nthe hospital™s mental health facility, NIU students are being transferred and admitted to hospitals \\n\\nin Aurora, Rockford, and Elgin for psychological care. To ensure continuity of care for our \\n\\nstudents, the CSDC staff is working to establish collaborative relationships with the behavioral \\n\\nmental health units and administrative staff of those surrounding hospitals. These bridge-building \\n\\nefforts will ensure that students receive the mental health care they need not only while in the \\n\\nhospital but also when they return to the university.\\nPRO\\nTOCOLS\\n AND\\n POLICIES\\nThere are two sets of policies for responding to students who display concerning behaviors. \\nFirst, the Involuntary University Withdrawal Policy for Threats Related to Mental or \\nPsychological Disorders (see Appendix G) is designed to provide timely and appropriate \\n\\nmeans of responding to a student whose behavior is related to mental health or psychological \\ndisorder(s) and poses a direct threat of harm to self or others. When the policy is activated by \\n\\nany Student Affairs Associate or Assistant Vice President, the student is immediately withdrawn \\n\\nfrom the institution. Once the policy is activated, the student receives a mandatory psychological \\n\\nstudent™s ability to re-enter the institution and be a positive member of the campus community.\\nSecond, the Student Code of Conduct (see Appendix D) outlines university policies and judicial \\nprocesses. The judicial process not only provides behavioral expectations for students, but \\nalso allows the institution to deal with inappropriate, threatening, or disruptive behaviors with \\nsanctions that encourage counseling, require behavioral interventions, or, at its extreme, suspend \\n\\nor expel students from the university. The Code also allows for immediate, but temporary, \\n\\nremoval of students from a portion or all of university property, allowing time for the university \\n\\nto fully investigate a situation when a student has allegedly shown behaviors that are perceived \\nto be threatening to him/her self or others. Additionally, the \\nContract for University Housing  CAMPUS\\n PR\\nOCEDU\\nRES AND\\n INITIATI\\nVES55CAMPUS\\n PR\\nOCEDU\\nRES AND\\n INITIATI\\nVESallows senior administrators in Housing and Dining to remove a student immediately from the Educating and Supporting the Campus CommunityThe Faculty & Staff Guide for Assisting Emotionally Troubled Students, \\nmentioned above, provides the campus community with Information regarding signs of an emotionally troubled studentInstructions on whom to contact, based on the immediacy of the concern an overview of the Involuntary University Withdrawal Policy for Threats Related to \\nMental or Psychological Disorders\\nInstructions on responding to a violent intruder or active shooter, and \\nA list of emergency resources for consultation and referral. This guide was created and \\ndistributed to all faculty and staff members in Fall 2007, prior to the campus tragedy. \\nAdditionally, in that semester and continuing in Spring 2008, the Division of Student \\n\\nAffairs conducted training sessions with academic deans and department faculty on \\n\\nidentifying and reporting students of concern (see Appendix F)\\nOne future challenge for the NIU campus is to remain responsive to students of concern. In an \\neffort to remind faculty and staff members of the important information contained in the \\nFaculty & Staff Guide for Assisting Emotionally Troubled Students\\n, a memorandum was sent to the \\ncampus community during the Fall 2009 semester to encourage them to review the guidelines. \\nThese guidelines were also provided in the Faculty Guide to Student Affairs\\n and distributed to all faculty in Fall 2009. Additionally, as students returned to campus in Fall 2009, they \\n\\nalso received information on how to report people of concern and that encouraged them to be \\nresponsible community members by reporting any suspicious or disturbing situations. 56CAMPUS\\n PR\\nOCEDU\\nRES AND\\n INITIATI\\nVESCAMPUS\\n PR\\nOCEDU\\nRES AND\\n INITIATI\\nVESStudent Affairs Staff Training for Emergencies\\nTEAM\\n TRAINING\\nThreat Assessment Teams\\nThe creation of the Threat Assessment Teams was a methodical and intentional process. They \\nwere derived from researching best practices, the legal implications of threat assessment, and \\nthe establishment of operational procedures. The teams also participated in numerous training \\n\\nopportunities.First, a team of four NIU staff members traveled to Virginia Tech for a joint training session. \\nVirginia Tech also created threat assessment teams in the aftermath of their shooting, as \\n\\nmandated by their state legislature. The two-day training included presentations by Dr. Ronald \\n\\nKessler, one of the nation™s experts on community violence prevention, conversations with Mr. \\n\\nBill Modeleski, Associate Assistant Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education™s \\n\\n\\ntragedy on their students, and lessons learned from the shooting experiences and the creation of \\nthe teams.Second, the teams invited Dr. John Dunkle to campus for a daylong workshop. Dr. Dunkle is a \\nleading authority on the Assessment-Intervention of Student Problems model, a model designed \\n\\nto identify students exhibiting disturbing behaviors and to assess the level of threat.Third, LeRoy Rooker presented to the NIU threat assessment teams in July 2009. Mr.\\n Rooker is the nation™s leading authority on the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) \\n\\n\\n\\n(FPCO) in the Department of Education for 21 years.Last, individual members of the threat assessment teams attended a variety of training sessions at local, regional, and national conferences. Two team members also attended the Campus Security \\n\\nEnhancement Act Forum where Representative Robert W. Pritchard (R-IL) discussed the state \\n\\nlegislation, which he co-authored, that mandates the creation of these teams in all institutions of \\nhigher education in the state of Illinois.Division of Student Affairs™ Crisis Response Team\\n\\nconducts an annual review of the team™s operations and communication. Most recently, this \\n\\nannual review brought about positive changes in the team that included the designation of \\nbilingual staff members to communicate with native-speaking family members, and the use of \\n\\nwalkie-talkies and laptop computers as back-up communication systems.The team also spends time each year engaged in a table-top exercise, a valuable tool for assessing the team™s effectiveness.

It is imperative that staff \\nmembers be fully trained in crisis management, mental health issues, and appropriate referral \\nresources. Prior to each fall semester, all professional and graduate residence hall staff members \\n\\nreceive training on identifying and responding to students of concern. These training sessions \\n\\nare facilitated annually by the CSDC staff. On-going training is also provided for the residence \\n\\n\\n\\nTraumatic Stress Disorder, eating disorders, or depression. In March 2009, a training session \\n\\nwas provided for professional and graduate hall staff members on how to recognize and assist \\n\\nstudents with mental health issues, and how to respond to suicidal students.Community Advisors (CAs) also receive training on mental health issues prior to the start of \\neach school year. Annually, CSDC staff members provide training on the services provided by \\n\\nthe CSDC, how to identify mental health concerns, paraprofessional counseling skill building, \\nand crisis management. A portion of this training is dedicated to experiential learning, allowing \\n\\nCAs to participate in a simulation of situations they might encounter. The CAs attended a \\n\\ndevelopmental training session in March 2009, as noted above. 58CAMPUS\\n PR\\nOCEDU\\nRES AND\\n INITIATI\\nVESCAMPUS\\n PR\\nOCEDU\\nRES AND\\n INITIATI\\nVESInformation Flow During a CrisisCOMMUNICA\\nTIONS\\n DURING\\n THE\\n FEBRUARY\\n 14 CRISIS\\nCall Center\\n\\nlines to be utilized as the university™s ﬁhotlinesﬂ throughout the crisis. Public Affairs posted the \\n\\nphone numbers on the university™s website homepage to inform the public of this resource. Crisis \\n\\nhotlines were utilized during the incident to address questions about the situation and related \\nadministrative decisions (e.g., cancellation of classes, schedule changes, etc). The hotlines were \\n\\n\\nfaculty, staff, and others.\\nAlthough the university website provided timely and accurate updates about the crisis situation, \\nmany individuals, especially family members, wanted to speak personally with someone on campus \\n\\nto gain assurance that the environment was safe and under control. The personal interaction was \\n\\ninvaluable and a powerful communication tool.Having learned the importance of keeping call center staff apprised of the most accurate and \\ntimely information throughout the February 14 crisis, Student Affairs intentionally gathered \\n\\ninformation from multiple sources that included the NIU website, reports from Student Affairs \\n\\nstaff stationed at Kishwaukee Hospital, information from NIU Public Safety and Public Affairs \\n\\n\\n\\nby the Vice President for Student Affairs.\\n\\ncontinually refreshed the NIU website at their workstations and read new postings to callers. In \\nthe aftermath of the tragedy, the crisis hotlines received over 19,000 calls over 10 days, 14,950 \\n\\n\\n\\nincluding updates regarding the crisis situation (e.g., parents picking up their children, safety of \\nthose still on campus); assistance locating family members; press and foreign consulate requests; \\ncampus closing/cancellation decisions (e.g., academic schedule questions, housing and meal plan \\nissues); insurance and medical reimbursement questions, and offers of support from community \\n\\nmembers and professional counselors.The crisis hotline was continually monitored by members of the Student Affairs Crisis Response \\n\\n\\nstatus reports were provided to the Vice President for Student Affairs throughout the 10-day \\n\\nduration, allowing him to oversee the operation.Since the February 14, 2008, crisis, the Vice President for Student Affairs and staff members who \\n\\nenhancements include: CAMPUS\\n PR\\nOCEDU\\nRES AND\\n INITIATI\\nVES59CAMPUS\\n PR\\nOCEDU\\nRES AND\\n INITIATI\\nVESProvision for additional phone and computer lines to host up to 13 hotline staff\\nthe Campus Life BuildingPre-established crisis hotline staff of 17 individuals who will automatically report to the \\n\\n\\nSeven pre-established hotline staff ﬁshift leadersﬂ who will guide the operation, allowing \\nCrisis Response Team members to focus on other crisis-related tasks\\nOutreach to Students Directly Impacted\\nIn addition to responding to calls from students, faculty, staff, and the general public, on \\n\\n\\ninitiative to reach out to every student enrolled in Geology 104 and Computer Science 205, the \\nclasses held in Cole Hall at the time of the shooting.

This group, now called ﬁHealing Huskies,ﬂ has not only continued, but has \\n\\nalso expanded to include any student who lost a loved one. The group was well received and has \\n\\nbeen a source of healing and strength for students navigating the grieving process.The Northern PactThe February 14 tragedy challenged the university to reshape its community as it re-established \\nstudents™ expectations during their time as Huskies. ﬁThe Northern Pactﬂ was created to help \\n\\nstudents understand and embrace these expectations. Five principles Œ just, open, caring, \\ndisciplined, and celebrative Œ were intentionally integrated into the campus culture.The focus of this initiative was to have students embrace this renewed sense of Huskie Pride by signing the Northern Pact Pledge and receiving a t-shirt that further promoted the initiative. \\nStudents who signed the pledge entered into an agreement between NIU and themselves, making \\n\\ndaily lives. Students were given the opportunity to sign Pact pledges at many of the Welcome \\n\\nWeek activities at the beginning of each fall semester. To date, over 11,000 students have pledged \\n\\nto build a stronger student culture at NIU.A variety of very successful marketing and programming efforts also were created around the \\nNorthern Pact. A survey of students indicated that 87 percent of the students had seen and were \\n\\naware of the Pact concept.In the 2009-2010 academic year, the Northern Pact has been creatively incorporated into a \\nvariety of initiatives. These include Orientation activities that engaged the participation of \\n\\nincoming students and their families. Students had opportunities to sign the Pact pledge at \\nWelcome Week activities publicized and open to all students on campus. As the university \\n\\ncontinues to move forward, its goal is to reach every student and to persist in its progress toward \\nbuilding an improved campus community.\\n CAMPUS\\n PR\\nOCEDU\\nRES AND\\n INITIATI\\nVES63CAMPUS\\n PR\\nOCEDU\\nRES AND\\n INITIATI\\nVESAcademic Implications of the 2/14 Tragedy\\nOn March 9, 2010, Enough is Enough: a student affairs perspective on preparedness and \\nresponse to a campus shooting was released by the publisher. The publication, edited by NIU™s \\n\\nown Brian Hemphill and Brandi Hephner LaBanc, focuses on both the Virginia Tech and the \\n\\nNorthern Illinois University shootings and provides an overview of some of the academic \\nand campus-wide issues that arose following the shootings on both campuses. Issues such as \\n\\ncrisis, emotional and mental health issues on a campus in the aftermath of a crisis and long-term \\nhealing of a campus in crisis are addressed in this publication. In the immediate aftermath of the campus shooting on February 14, 2008, NIU administrators struggled with issues such as closing down the campus, when and how to reopen the \\ncampus after such a tragedy, providing counseling to faculty and staff in advance of the \\n\\ncampus reopening, relocating dozens of classes to alternate venues throughout the campus, \\ncommunicating those new locations to faculty, staff and students, providing faculty with \\n\\nappropriate guidelines to assist students struggling with emotional and/or physical injuries \\nsuffered during the tragedy, and rescheduling the academic calendar for that semester including \\n\\npostponing graduation an additional week. Thousands of lives were forever changed that fateful day as the result of the tragic shooting that occurred in Cole Hall. On February 14, 2008, that building was taken out of service and has yet \\nto be restored. As the main lecture hall facility for all large undergraduate sections of general \\n\\neducation coursework, Cole Hall™s closure has a continued impact as virtually every NIU student \\n\\ntakes at least one class there. Each chapter of Enough is Enough focuses on a particular aspect of the impact of mass violence on campus. Chapter 7, co-authored by NIU Executive Vice President and Provost Raymond W. \\nAlden III and Deputy Provost Harold Kafer, details the response to the academic impact and \\n\\nimplications caused by the shootings at NIU on February 14, 2008 (see Appendix H). \\n 64CAMPUS\\n PR\\nOCEDU\\nRES AND\\n INITIATI\\nVESCAMPUS\\n PR\\nOCEDU\\nRES AND\\n INITIATI\\nVESInformation Technology Services Crisis Communications \\nUpdateMultiple tests with all cellular companies have been carried out. Over 11,000 students, faculty \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nconnected to the text alert system via NIUNet so that all NIU campuses can be reached. An \\n\\nupcoming addition anticipated in Spring 2010 will add a blast message feature to anyone logged \\ninto NIU™s Novell servers. This includes all ITS Student Computer Labs and many of the college \\n\\ncomputer labs and the majority of employees online. Additionally, ITS will add a broadcast \\n\\nmessage to all 20 NIU-IPTV channels for NIU residence halls and any classrooms watching the \\n\\nNIU-IPTV channels.\\nITS has also recommended central control over PA and Fire Alarm speakers using NIUNet and \\n\\n\\nalarm systems. Project design for this has been completed and funding for an 8-building trial \\nhas been approved. Installation is underway for summer 2010 testing. ITS also developed an \\nalternative printing method for the NIU Emergency Guide that reduced its cost and improved \\n\\ncontent information using a new ﬁon-demandﬂ color printer. In addition, a complete Emergency \\n\\nOperations Plan has been developed for the ITS headquarters and has been integrated with the \\nmain campus Emergency Operations Plan.\\n CAMPUS\\n PR\\nOCEDU\\nRES AND\\n INITIATI\\nVES65CAMPUS\\n PR\\nOCEDU\\nRES AND\\n INITIATI\\nVESEmergency First Responders/Campus Planning and Training\\nThe DeKalb Fire Department and the NIU Department of Public Safety have established a functional working model that includes an initial emergency medical response from NIU Public \\n\\n\\n\\nearly medical intervention even when the scene of an emergency, such as occurred on February \\n\\n14, 2008, has not yet been determined to be safe. It also provides much-needed additional trained \\nresponders during a mass casualty incident. A standing meeting between NIU Public Safety and DeKalb EMS/Fire is scheduled each \\nmonth to ensure continuity of operations. Additionally, regular meetings between the Fire and \\n\\nPolice Chiefs are scheduled as required to address any remaining issues of concern. NIU Public \\nSafety and the DeKalb Fire Department work side-by-side to ensure areas of mutual interest \\nare addressed utilizing the same instructors, training courses, training regimens and compatible \\nequipment. An example of this cooperation is demonstrated by the fact that the DeKalb Fire \\n\\nDepartment was instrumental in getting approximately one-third of NIU™s police personnel \\n\\n\\nthrough levels A and B. The two agencies, in addition to other area service providers, also \\n\\ncooperate to jointly create and develop Incident Action Plans (IAP™s) for every event of \\n\\nconsequence involving the university. \\nNIU Public Safety is currently working on an in-house liaison program through which a member and Planning, a specialized unit of NIU Public Safety, as an advisor. These agencies also work \\n\\ntogether each year to plan and exercise their respective emergency response procedures, which \\n\\ninclude hazardous materials spills and mass casualty events. These plans and exercises also \\n\\ninclude other appropriate regional emergency service providers.

The following are key lessons learned from the \\n\\nStudent Affairs perspective:\\n\\n: It is important to have a comprehensive crisis response plan that \\nincludes protocols for dealing with student deaths, student psychological issues and needs, \\n\\nand campus violence; but it is imperative to actively practice crisis response and have the \\n\\ninfrastructure in place and ready to deploy at a moment™s notice. Included in the Crisis \\n\\nResponse Plan should be an ﬁInvoluntary University Withdrawal Policy for Threats Related \\n\\n\\n\\n(SSAO) or the designee to withdraw a student who poses a direct threat to him/herself or \\n\\nothers.\\n\\n This team should be led by an Associate or Assistant Vice \\n\\n\\ncoordinating and communicating with senior university administrators to fully supervise \\n\\nand dispatch the Crisis Response Team. Reserve a room with conference-call capabilities \\n\\nand establish a set schedule for Crisis Response Team updates; have members call in to the \\n\\nupdate meeting, if they are unable to leave their posts. If dealing with a large-scale crisis, it \\n\\nwill be necessary to create a specialized work schedule for the Crisis Response Team, and \\n\\nto have a secondary team on call that consists of 10 to 15 staff members regardless of title \\n\\nor rank.

Campus counselors will be engaged \\n\\nwith students at the scene, and additional mental health clinicians will be needed in \\n\\nresidence halls, adjoining classrooms and facilities, with student organizations, and in the \\n\\nstudent center. It is also helpful to establish an alternative schedule of operations for the \\n\\ncampus counseling center that allows 24-hour services for a time immediately following the \\n\\nincident; it is also important to have bilingual clinicians on site for each shift.\\n\\ns: Select and train a team of 20 or more victim liaisons to assist impacted \\nstudents and families with funerals, retrieving belongings, contacting insurance carriers, \\n\\n\\n\\nthese roles should be thoroughly trained in advance on state and county victim resources. \\n\\n(Supervisors of chosen victim liaisons should be consulted before the training process \\n\\nbegins, to apprise them that these individuals will be unable to devote full time to their \\n\\nusual duties.)\\n\\n: For institutions with a Latino student population or other non-native \\nEnglish-speaking students, it is essential to have bilingual staff members who can interpret \\n\\nfor families and who can address the media. Create and maintain a list of bilingual \\n\\nemployees and their contact information.\\n\\n Be sure an alternative communication system is \\navailable, in addition to landline telephones and cell phones. Traditional communication \\n\\nsystems become overloaded almost immediately. An alternative system, like hand-held \\n\\nradios, will allow for continued communication with the Crisis Response Team and with \\n\\nother key college leaders. It is also important to have guest login access available on all \\n\\ncomputers in the crisis command center. Additional laptops with guest login access should \\n\\nalso be available.\\n\\n: Seek advice early in a crisis from Student Affairs colleagues at \\nother institutions who have experienced similar campus violence. Request help from local \\n\\nand regional universities and disaster relief organizations.\\n\\n: Use Facebook and other social networking sites \\n\\n\\nThis information provides a broader picture of the deceased and injured as well as a means \\n\\n\\n\\n: Have a pre-established spreadsheet template created to track \\nimpacted students and to keep a record of communications with those students.

Follow-up calls are highly recommended in order to track how well students \\n\\nclosest to the tragedy are coping. A similar template can be used to track phone calls to the \\n\\nhotlines and for returning voice mail messages.\\n\\n: Be prepared to be asked by university leadership to manage \\nfunctions outside the Student Affairs domain. For example, staff may be asked to \\n\\ncoordinate training for faculty and staff to prepare them for students™ return to campus; \\n\\nprovide classroom resources for faculty regarding student-counseling services; respond to \\n\\nmedia; and handle other logistical details, such as funeral attendance and public vigils and \\n\\nmemorials.\\n\\n: Anticipate the long-term impact of a campus tragedy and consider a \\ndivision-wide strategy for a transition period. To that end, consider how to welcome new \\n\\nstudents to campus who are removed from the tragedy; some students will be curious, \\n\\nothers may be insensitive. \\nConclusion\\n\\nThe Northern Illinois University community remains committed to the process of healing and \\n\\nrecovery, as demonstrated by the combined efforts of its students, faculty, and staff in the wake \\n\\nof the February 14 tragedy. Student Affairs is grateful for all the support provided to NIU during \\n\\n\\n\\nenforcement agencies, colleagues at Virginia Tech, and the many great institutions of higher \\n\\neducation across the nation.\\n DIVISION\\n OF STUDENT\\n AFF\\nAIRSRESPONSE AND \\nRECO\\nVERY\\n REPO\\nRT FOR FEBR\\nUA\\nRY\\n 14, 2008\\n97THE\\n COMM\\nUNIVE\\nRSITY RES\\nPONSE\\n TO\\n FEB\\nRU\\nARY 14, 2008\\nThe impact of the February 14, 2008 shooting at Northern Illinois University was felt far beyond \\nthe boundaries of the campus. The citizens of the DeKalb/Sycamore area experienced shock, \\n\\npain and grief as they realized that a tragic act of violence had occurred in their community.  \\n\\nFor years, university and community leaders had used the phrase ﬁcommuniversityﬂ to describe \\n\\nthe unity of the community and the university.  In many respects, the use of the word had been \\n\\naspirational, a repeated attempt to convince everyone that there was merit in nurturing a close \\n\\nand cooperative relationship between the university and its host community. As the full extent of \\n\\nthe tragedy at NIU became known, ﬁcommuniversityﬂ evolved from concept to reality. \\n\\nmany local citizens were of individual students, faculty and staff members. They immediately \\n\\ncalled to check on the well-being of their neighbors, friends, family members, fellow church \\n\\n\\n\\nthey established that the individuals they knew personally were safe, community members then \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\njob to do and they were working at maximum capacity to handle the situation. What part could \\n\\nothers play in helping those affected? \\nLocal businesses, families and individuals immediately began looking for opportunities to \\ndemonstrate their support for NIU. On Friday, February 15, red and black ribbons and posters \\n\\nsprang up all over town, with posters declaring ﬁWe™re praying for you, NIUﬂ and ﬁStay strong, \\n\\n\\n\\nin front of the Family Service Agency and quickly became a common refrain throughout the \\n\\ncommunity as people came together to support one another and those directly impacted by the \\n\\ntragedy. The DeKalb and Sycamore high school basketball teams put aside their own school \\n\\ncolors and wore red and black as a show of support for NIU.  The DeKalb and Sycamore \\n\\nChambers of Commerce established a memorial fund in response to countless members who \\n\\nexpressed their desire to contribute in some way. \\n\\nresponse to the DeKalb/Sycamore community still reeling themselves from the impact of the \\n\\ntragedy, it became clear that a process was needed to funnel the requests for information and \\n\\noffers of assistance.  \\n 98TH\\nE COMMUNI\\nVERSIT\\nY RESPONSE\\n TO\\n FEBR\\nUA\\nRY 14, 2008\\nTH\\nE COMMUNI\\nVERSIT\\nY RESPONSE\\n TO\\n FEBR\\nUA\\nRY 14, 2008\\nThe Communiversity Cares \\nInitiative \\nThe university was closed immediately following the tragedy, and the week of February 18 \\nwas established by NIU President John G.

A local printing company had rushed production \\n\\nof a small quantity so the signs could be displayed as soon as \\n\\npossible.  A second poster was prepared reading ﬁForward, \\n\\nTogether Forwardﬂ using the Huskie logo along with the \\n\\nCity of DeKalb and City of Sycamore logos to demonstrate \\n\\nthe unity of the university and its host cities.  Ten thousand \\n\\nposters were printed, and a group of volunteers distributed \\n\\nthem throughout the area.  Posters were also available at the \\n\\nDeKalb and Sycamore Chambers of Commerce.  From the \\n\\nbeginning of the Communiversity Cares Initiative, the intent \\n\\nwas to be forward-focused, recognizing a need to move beyond \\n\\ngrieving to healing and beyond sympathy to encouragement \\n\\nand strength. Over a period of months in 2009, a second and \\n\\nthird version of the posters were designed and printed, moving \\n\\nfrom the use of the black ribbon Huskie logo to the regular \\n\\nHuskie logo and eventually to a sign that reads ﬁWe are One \\n\\nCommuniversity: NIU, DeKalb and Sycamore.ﬂ \\none\\nwe are\\n\\nCOMMUNIVERSITY 100\\nTH\\nE COMMUNI\\nVERSIT\\nY RESPONSE\\n TO\\n FEBR\\nUA\\nRY 14, 2008\\nTH\\nE COMMUNI\\nVERSIT\\nY RESPONSE\\n TO\\n FEBR\\nUA\\nRY 14, 2008\\nRed and black ribbons\\n. NIU students, local K-12 students and other community volunteers made \\nred and black ribbons so everyone could demonstrate their solidarity by wearing a ribbon on their \\nlapel.  Local retailers quickly exhausted their supplies and were calling on suppliers all over the \\n\\ncountry to rush red and black ribbon to DeKalb. The Chambers and many local businesses had \\n\\nribbons available in their lobbies for patrons. \\nIn order to provide a welcoming atmosphere for students returning to campus on February 24 \\nfor the memorial service at the Convocation Center, special banners were posted on street light \\n\\npoles along Annie Glidden Road and Lincoln Highway.  These banners were a warm reminder to \\n\\nstudents of the community™s concern and affection for them. \\nMedia involvement.\\n The local newspaper, the \\nDaily Chronicle\\n, posted an on-line community \\ndiary for citizens to share their thoughts. They also established an on-line bulletin board of \\nsorts, for announcements from the university and community.  WLBK and B95 Radio produced \\n\\nidentical public service announcements expressing the community™s support.  \\n\\nOn February 14, the DeKalb and Sycamore communities were shocked and saddened \\nby what happened to our extended family at Northern Illinois University. Like all true \\n\\nfamilies, we™ve come together in this hour of need.  This is a time to lean on each other for \\n\\nstrength and to reach out to our fellow citizens as we try to deal with a tragedy that struck \\n\\nso close to home. \\nAll of us at [station name] are proud of the people of DeKalb, Sycamore and NIU for \\nthe strength and courage they have shown.  Our community will rise to share the goal: \\n\\nForward, Together Forward. \\nEmbracing place-bound students \\n\\nDeb Pierce, NIU™s Associate Provost for International Programs, joined the Communiversity \\n\\nCares Initiative to address the plight of NIU™s international students. While the majority of NIU \\n\\nstudents were able to go home to be with their families immediately following the tragedy, most \\n\\nof the international students were still in town, unable to return home on such short notice and \\n\\nwith only a week before classes would resume.  The United Way and the DeKalb and Sycamore \\n\\nChambers partnered with local churches and other faith-based organizations to host a series of \\n\\ndinners for international students. Scores of community volunteers were on hand to talk with \\n\\nstudents and ensure they weren™t isolated and fearful in the wake of the tragedy. \\nIn addition, the YMCA and many other local organizations opened their doors and welcomed \\nplace-bound students and those who were in DeKalb to assist with the aftermath of the tragedy to \\n\\nutilize their facilities and services at no charge. \\nWelcoming students back to campus \\nOne of the guiding principles of the Communiversity Cares Initiative was to create simple ways \\n\\nfor all area residents, regardless of their profession or socioeconomic level, to participate.

The \\ngroup decided to solicit donations of cookies and have community volunteers distribute them in \\n\\n\\n\\nat school.  A comfort food committee set an initial goal of collecting 25,000 cookies. Within 24 \\n\\nhours, more than 40,000 cookies had been pledged by local bakeries, restaurants, grocery stores, \\n\\n\\n\\nfrom all over the community and stored them at Kishwaukee Community Hospital. To ensure \\n\\n\\n\\ntown: we need labels printed and donated.  On February 22, more than 200 volunteers packaged \\n\\ncookies in plastic bags, and each bag was tagged with a sticker that read: ﬁWelcome back! Your \\n\\nDeKalb/Sycamore community cares about you.ﬂ  On February 25 and 26, the cookies were \\n\\ndistributed in locations all over campus by smiling volunteers who offered encouragement, hugs \\n\\nand sympathetic shoulders to those who needed them.  \\nCommunity outreach \\nWhile mental health professionals and counselors from across the country were coming in to aid \\n\\nuniversity and local providers in ensuring appropriate care for the NIU family, a strong effort \\n\\nwas made to ensure that such services were also available community-wide. Local agencies, led \\n\\nby the Ben Gordon Center, held workshops on trauma, grief and how to talk to children about the \\n\\nevents that had occurred. Additional services and referral mechanisms for community service \\n\\nproviders, the faith community, community groups, schools, and parent-teacher organizations \\n\\nwere provided. \\nThe many activities of the Communiversity Cares Initiative were carried out through donations \\nof volunteer time and free and discounted products and services from area businesses and \\n\\n\\n\\nnumber of expenses from a special emergency fund. \\nHuskies on \\nParade \\nAs classes resumed and the semester continued, the Communiversity Cares Initiative group \\nreconvened to discuss progress made and opportunities for future collaboration built on an \\n\\nenhanced feeling of unity and mutual support in the communiversity. For many years, there had \\n\\nbeen discussion about the possibility of mounting a community-wide public art project, along \\n\\nthe lines of Chicago™s highly successful 1999 Cows on Parade.  The group decided the time had \\n\\ncome for Huskies on Parade, a fun and \\n\\ninclusive project that would provide an \\n\\nopportunity for area residents to continue \\n\\nto demonstrate their unity with NIU in an \\n\\nupbeat manner. The group set an ambitious \\n\\ngoal of having Huskies on display in the \\n\\ncommunity when NIU students returned \\n\\nto begin the 2008-2009 academic year. \\n 102\\nTH\\nE COMMUNI\\nVERSIT\\nY RESPONSE\\n TO\\n FEBR\\nUA\\nRY 14, 2008\\nA Huskies on Parade committee was established to undertake the project.  After ascertaining \\n\\n\\nHuskie dogs crafted by the same Chicago company that had made the cow statues for Chicago. A \\n\\ncall to artists went out, soliciting designs from anyone interested in painting dogs for the project.  \\n\\nOn June 18, a Huskie on Parade Adoption Party was held at the Barsema Alumni and Visitors \\n\\nCenter, where a large crowd got a sneak preview of the Huskie dog molds.  Artists displayed their \\n\\ndesigns and previous work and many sponsors committed to the project on the spot and chose \\n\\ntheir preferred artist at the same time.  For a $1,000 fee, the sponsors received a 40-inch Huskie \\n\\nand a 20-inch Huskie pup. The agreement was that the dogs would be decorated identically, and \\n\\nthe 20-inch pup would be returned to Huskies on Parade to be sold at a later date.  Ultimately, \\n\\nmore than 50 Huskies on Parade were sponsored by local artists and university and community \\n\\nsupporters.  The DeKalb and Sycamore High Schools shared sponsorship of a Huskie and painted \\n\\none side with DeKalb Barb colors and the other with Sycamore Spartan colors. The winner of the \\n\\n\\n\\nof the year. The City of DeKalb sponsored a Huskie and painted one side as a German shepherd \\n\\n\\n\\nfront of the DeKalb City Hall. \\nAt NIU™s Homecoming on October 18, the Huskies on Parade tent was the most popular spot \\non campus, as people vied for the opportunity to purchase the 20-inch Huskie pups. Most of \\n\\nthe pups were sold on site, fetching $500 each. A Chicago Bears Huskie, signed by former NIU \\n\\nfootball standout and current Chicago Bear Garrett Wolfe and several of his teammates, was \\n\\non display and was later auctioned on E-bay for $3,850. Thanks to the generosity of numerous \\n\\nvolunteers, sponsors and those who purchased the Huskie pups, the Huskies on Parade project \\n\\nended up contributing more than $40,000 to NIU™s February 14 Scholarship fund. Many of the \\n\\nHuskies on Parade are still displayed throughout the DeKalb/Sycamore community, brightly-\\n\\npainted reminders of the pride in the community and university that unites the communiversity. \\nForward, Together Forward \\nNo one would wish a tragedy of the magnitude of February 14 on any community, but once \\n\\nconfronted with such an event, the immediate outpouring of support and concern from \\n\\nindividuals, agencies and businesses throughout the DeKalb/Sycamore area is testament to NIU™s \\n\\nlong history in the community and the well-established connections between the university and \\n\\nits host community.

While his motive may never be fully understood, these experts \\n\\nbelieve that Kazmierczak™s decision to stop taking medicines for mental illness, in some measure, \\n\\nled to his criminal actions. He acted in a deliberate and premeditated fashion with malice of \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nindividuals in that building at the time of the shooting. Nor was there any evidence as to why \\n\\nKazmierczak chose NIU to carry out his deed, although his past association with the university \\n\\nclearly made it a familiar place and therefore a plausible target.\\nNIU Public Safety enlisted assistance from multiple experts and law enforcement entities as well \\n\\n\\nPolice investigative work continues, even now, as law enforcement works to learn additional \\n\\ndetails of the shooting and the reasons behind it.\\nIn the aftermath of the killings at Virginia Tech in 2007, institutions of higher education across \\nthe country reviewed emergency response and preparedness plans in an effort to strengthen \\n\\ntheir own plans. NIU did this as well and that, in large measure, accounts for the generally high \\n\\nmarks the university received for its prompt response and handling of the crisis as well as post-\\n\\nevent counseling, grieving, and unifying actions. Still, in the wake of the February 14, 2008 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ntheir essence remains intact. Should NIU reveal further explicit details of its response strategy it \\n\\nwould only compromise their effectiveness. \\n\\nprocedures and response actions as well as a review of procedures for follow-up investigative work, \\n\\ncommunications, and a plethora of issues in the area of student affairs, from counseling services \\n\\nto reintegration into campus life.

While we cannot recover the losses of the past, we do have a responsibility to bring \\n\\nmeaning and purpose from these terrible events.  \\n\\n \\nFollowing last year™s tragedy at Virginia Tech, \\nI established the State of Illinois Campus Security \\nTask Force.  This multi-disciplinary task force,\\n comprised of Illinois™ top leaders in education, \\nmental health, public safety and law enforcement,\\n has been charged with crafting better, more \\neffective campus security policies.  They have also\\n been charged with providing guidance directly to \\nhigher education campuses in order to improve mental health support on campus.   \\n I am proud that our State is in a position to take\\n proactive measures to prevent further acts of \\nviolence on Illinois campuses and to en\\nsure an effective response and recovery should they occur.  \\nThe Campus Security Task Force has successfully br\\nought the talent and resources of the Office of \\nthe Governor and leading members of the first response, academic and mental health communities, \\nas well the Office of the Attorney General togeth\\ner to provide a comprehensive report, detailing \\nbest practices, lessons learned and resources \\navailable to campuses to enhance preparedness, \\nresponse and recovery.  \\n\\n \\nThe Task Force has also proposed vital, new legisl\\nation and a new capital grant program intended to \\nensure effective planning for campus emergencie\\ns and to provide resources and equipment in \\nsupport of those efforts.  I intend to support these efforts, and I hope the General Assembly will \\n\\njoin me.  \\n \\nWorking together, we can implement this report™s r\\necommendations, use its guidance to significantly \\nimprove campus security in Illinois, and help pr\\nevent another tragic act of campus violence. \\n \\nThank you for being a part of the efforts of the Campus Security Task Force.

In \\nthe aftermath of that tragedy, my office worked\\n with many Illinois leaders in academics, law \\nenforcement, government and health care\\n to assess campus safety issues and develop \\nrecommendations.  \\nThen, on February 14, 2008, we were shocked an\\nd saddened by the tragedy that occurred at \\nNorthern Illinois University.  We continue to gr\\nieve with the university community and with the \\nfamilies and friends who lost loved ones.  We \\nare working with NIU to assist those who were \\ninjured and those who witnessed this devastating crime. \\n\\n \\nAs Attorney General of Illinois, I join with the \\nIllinois Campus Safety Task Force in presenting you \\nwith this report.  The Task Force fostered co\\noperation and dialogue among a full spectrum of \\n\\nparticipants to examine findings and reports fr\\nom the Virginia Tech tragedy, review State and \\nFederal legislation, share best practices, examine \\nchallenges, and make recommendations.  My office \\nchaired the Legal Subcommittee, which focused \\non perceived barriers in communication, the \\nappropriateness of information sharing, and the \\nintersection of information sharing with student \\nprivacy rights.    \\n \\nIllinois™ higher education campuses vary greatly fr\\nom school to school.  The Task Force™s findings, \\nrecommendations, and action plans recognize this \\ndiversity and strive to provide campuses with \\nguidance and resources to facilitate individual ca\\nmpus dialogue, examination and planning in campus \\nsafety and all hazards responses. \\n\\n \\nWe hope that this report will assist you in yo\\nur school™s ongoing review and development of \\nemergency response planning and protocols.  I woul\\nd like to thank all of the members of the Task \\nForce and their agencies for contributing to this report.

Blagojevich established the Stat\\ne of Illinois Campus Security Task Force (CSTF) \\nin April 2007, in response to the shooting incide\\nnt at Virginia Tech. CSTF was charged with the \\nmission of developing and implementing comprehens\\nive, coordinated policies and training programs \\nto deter, prevent and significantly enhance respon\\nse to, and recovery from, major public safety \\nincidents at all higher education campuses, public \\nand private, in Illinois. For the past year CSTF has \\nserved as the locus of Illinois™ comprehensive \\nand interdisciplinary efforts to enhance campus \\nsecurity. It is the intent of CSTF to carry on its \\nwork following the release of this Report to the \\nGovernor.  This Report of CSTF to the Governor represents \\nthe consensus of over 75 organizations from the \\nresponse, mental health, legal, and higher education communities. This Report is a tool for campus \\nleaders and their partners in surrounding communities, to use to enhance all facets of campus \\n\\nsecurity Œ prevention, response, recovery and rela\\nted legal issues. CSTF is proud to acknowledge \\n\\nthat its efforts, including campus security awaren\\ness training, radio distribution, and the general \\nsharing of best practices, have been recognized as having served to enhance the response to, and \\n\\nrecovery from, the recent incident at Northe\\nrn Illinois University. However, the incident on \\nFebruary 14, 2008 has also served to heighten\\n the need to utilize and advance the formal \\nrecommendations presented in this Report to the Governor. \\n  A-10\\nAPPENDI\\nX AŒS\\nTATE\\n OF ILLINOIS\\n CAMPUS\\n SECU\\nRIT\\nY TASK\\n FO\\nRCE\\n REPO\\nRT TO\\n THE GOVERNO\\nRAPPENDI\\nX AŒS\\nTATE\\n OF ILLINOIS\\n CAMPUS\\n SECU\\nRIT\\nY TASK\\n FO\\nRCE\\n REPO\\nRT TO\\n THE GOVERNO\\nR  \\n Organization Under the leadership of the Office of the Gover\\nnor, CSTF has been divided into three primary \\ncommittees:   Committee \\nChair \\nMission \\nThe Response Committee \\nDirector Illinois Emergency Management \\nAgency To review and recommend \\nenhancements to campus \\nsecurity preparedness and \\nresponse planning, and related \\ntraining. \\n The Prevention and Mental \\nHealth Committee \\nDirector Division of Mental Health \\nIllinois Department of Health & \\nHuman Services \\nTo review and recommend \\nenhancements to mental health \\npolicies, services, and issue \\nawareness to prevent, and \\nenhance response to and \\nrecovery from major incidents \\non higher education campuses \\nstatewide.  \\nThe Legal Committee Attorney General \\nState of Illinois Represented by IL AG Director of \\nPolicy To review and recommend \\nenhancements to legal issues \\nand policies related to higher \\neducation campus security in \\nIllinois.  The General Membership of CSTF has included\\n representatives from over 75 individual \\norganizations, drawn from the emergency response,\\n mental health services, legal, and higher \\neducation communities. \\n Approach & Process \\nCSTF has placed great emphasis on crafting both \\nnear-term deliverables and concrete guidance for \\nthe long-term, through the deliver\\ny of resources and training, a comprehensive survey of mental \\nhealth resources and issues, and providing a comprehensive, thorough and practical set of policy \\n\\nrecommendations designed for immediate implemen\\ntation and application. Some CSTF measures \\n\\nhave already been implemented, including distribution of interoperable radios to campus security \\n\\nofficials statewide, and the delivery of a campus \\nsecurity awareness training program statewide. \\nCSTF has also placed great emphasis on consensu\\ns building and interdisciplinary cooperation - each \\nCSTF committee included representatives from each of the major, participating disciplines. CSTF \\n\\nhas met as a full-body four times as of the rele\\nase of this report, with intermittent sub-committee \\nmeetings. \\n  APPENDI\\nX AŒS\\nTATE\\n OF ILLINOIS\\n CAMPUS\\n SECU\\nRIT\\nY TASK\\n FO\\nRCE\\n REPO\\nRT TO\\n THE GOVERNO\\nRA-11\\nAPPENDI\\nX AŒS\\nTATE\\n OF ILLINOIS\\n CAMPUS\\n SECU\\nRIT\\nY TASK\\n FO\\nRCE\\n REPO\\nRT TO\\n THE GOVERNO\\nR  \\n 2.\\nFindings and Recommendations \\n The three committees of CSTF offer the follo\\nwing recommendations for consideration, \\nimplementation, and utilization statewide. \\n \\nResponse Committee  Findings \\nInteragency and multi-jurisdictional cooperation \\namong all parties is vital to successfully \\nmanaging emergencies, and requires that agencies and jurisdictions have the capability to \\nefficiently and effectively communicate with each other during a critical incident. \\nA strong system of unified command and control of\\n an incident is essential for the coordination \\nof resources necessary to mitiga\\nte threats to life and property.  \\nAll-hazards planning is the standard for emer\\ngency preparedness. Development of strong all-\\nhazards emergency plans will allow campuses to more quickly respond to natural and manmade \\nemergency situations. Campus emergency plans, \\nprocedures and key information should be \\nupdated regularly and provide for revision based on actual emergencies or exercises. Colleges \\nand universities should conduct a risk analysis \\nor threat assessment in collaboration with local \\nfirst responders and emergency management agency\\n and select a level of security appropriate to \\ntheir campus. \\nComprehensive training and exercise of emerge\\nncy response plans and systems are a necessary \\npart of emergency preparedness. Training for st\\naff, faculty and students in recognizing and \\nunderstanding emergency alerts and the appropria\\nte immediate response actions are essential to \\nsafeguarding lives. \\nDevelopment of robust, redundant, multi-moda\\nl, internal communication systems that reach \\nstudents, faculty, and staff can expedite disse\\nmination of important, sometimes life-saving, \\ninformation.    \\n Recommendations \\nColleges and universities should ensure that all \\nagencies that are or may be involved in the \\nresponse to an emergency on their campuses ar\\ne trained in National Incident Management \\nSystem (NIMS), which should form the common operating structure for any response. All key \\ndecision makers at a college or university should be familiar with NIMS.\\n1 Colleges and universities should make development and implementation of interoperable \\ncommunications among response agencies a ce\\nntral focus of campus emergency planning. \\nCommunications plans should be regularly tested. The statewide StarCom21 system provides a \\nmechanism for colleges and universities to coordinate response activities with outside public \\nsafety agencies. \\nColleges and universities should adopt the Incide\\nnt Command System (ICS) model, delineated in \\nNIMS, as the basis for command and control in the event of an emergency.  All first responders \\nand key college and university personnel should be familiar with ICS. Colleges and universities should develop an all-hazards emergency response plan to address \\nthose hazards that may threaten their campus.

The all-hazards planning \\nprocess requires assessment of the needs of all re\\nlevant stakeholders, including students, faculty \\nand staff. Colleges and universities should take steps to se\\ne that their campus first responders, who will be \\nrelied upon in the execution of their all-hazard \\nplans, are appropriately trained and exercised. Colleges and universities should ensure that stud\\nents, faculty and staff are informed regarding \\ntheir roles and responsibilities in preparing for and responding to emergency situations.  Colleges and universities should work to develop and implement strong internal emergency \\ncommunications and notifications systems for their campuses. These systems should use a range \\nof technologies and redundant features. \\n   APPENDI\\nX AŒS\\nTATE\\n OF ILLINOIS\\n CAMPUS\\n SECU\\nRIT\\nY TASK\\n FO\\nRCE\\n REPO\\nRT TO\\n THE GOVERNO\\nRA-13\\nAPPENDI\\nX AŒS\\nTATE\\n OF ILLINOIS\\n CAMPUS\\n SECU\\nRIT\\nY TASK\\n FO\\nRCE\\n REPO\\nRT TO\\n THE GOVERNO\\nR  \\n Prevention and Mental Health Committee\\nFindings \\nCreating a healthy campus culture, while pr\\nomoting awareness and prevention, can reduce \\nthe risk of mental health related incidents.  \\nAssuring access to an array of timely and appropr\\niate mental health services can help address \\nconcerns about at-risk students, as defined and identified by campus policies and officials. \\nPlanning for the securing, and managing of addi\\ntional clinical support services as part of a \\ncollege or university™s Crisis Management Protoc\\nol (CMP) is essential to effective recovery \\noperations.  Recommendations \\nDevelop culturally and linguistically appropriate messages to de-stigmatize mental illness as well as other illnesses, while normalizing all attem\\npts to seek assistance and treatment for self \\nand for others.  Teach that ﬁcodes of silenceﬂ or keeping silent about a person™s pain or \\ndistress may lead to negative outcomes. \\nExpand both formal and informal opportunities for entering students to integrate into the campus community with the goals of establishing\\n viable social networks and reducing social \\nisolation. Provide collaborative training opportunities on si\\ngns, symptoms and early identification of \\nmental illness or other behavioral patterns that may be predictive of violence, on violence prevention strategies, and on response protocols for a variety of potential incidents. \\nResearch has indicated that the risk of violence may increase when other risk factors are \\npresent, such as substance abuse, lack of personal supports and exposure to destabilizers.  Training should be targeted to campus security \\nforces and first responders, health services personnel, counselors, resident advisors, coaches, and student/minority affairs staff.   \\nWidely distribute and/or facilitate access to \\nawareness and prevention information on early signs of mental illness and the importance of seeking help, violence prevention, and \\nsubstance abuse awareness and prevention.  Cons\\nider incorporating existing anti-stigma \\ncampaigns (SAMHSA™s ﬁWhat a Difference a Friend Makesﬂ campaign, Illinois Department \\nof Human Services™ ﬁSay it Out Loudﬂ campaign) into faculty, student and staff orientations \\nand campus life programs (See Appendix B, Parts I-IV).\\n2 Develop non-discriminatory campus policies that promote awareness and prevention \\nactivities.   See www.bazelon.org/pdf/Supporti\\nngStudents.pdf. (See Appendix B, Part V). \\nDevelop ﬁthreat assessmentﬂ teams and procedures that delineate actions that should be \\ntaken in the face of a potential or actual\\n threat.  The purpose of the team is both \\ninvestigational and interventional.  Teams should be multidisciplinary in composition, must have a senior clinical staff member as we\\nll as representation from Student Affairs and campus security, and should meet with some regularity. Policy considerations must be \\ncareful not to erode the rights of persons in n\\need or create additional barriers to treatment.  \\nTask Force members strongly advise consulting\\n expert guidance in establishing policies and \\nprocedures for this team (See Appendix B, Part VI). \\nUse the International Association of Counseling Services (IACS) Guidelines for best \\n\\n2 \\nThreat Assessment in Schools: A Guide to\\n Managing Threatening Situations and to\\n Creating Safe School Climates (2002).\\n Published \\nby the United States Secret\\n Service and the United States Department\\n of Education.

IACS offers accreditation standards for university and college counseling centers and cites optimal staff-student ratios, clinical \\nguidelines and other guidelines for providing high quality mental health services. \\nWhere there are gaps in mental health services\\n develop formal or informal agreements with local community mental health providers to au\\ngment services available on the campus.  The \\nIllinois Department of Human Services, Division of Mental Health (DMH) can assist in \\nbrokering these agreements. Attempt to eliminate all waiting lists for se\\nrvices by increasing personnel on campus or through relationships with community and contractual providers.  Technology (e.g., telemedicine, telepsychiatry) may be useful in in\\ncreasing access, especially in rural areas.  Assure that all persons experiencing a mental health crisis have access to immediate \\nintervention in order to determine level of care\\n needed and specifically to assess degree of danger to self and others.  Consider implementing crisis intervention teams on campus, \\nstaffed with individuals well versed in mental health crisis management. \\nIdentify an office or person responsible for providing mental health counseling referral \\ninformation for students and employees and make certain that office/person is well known \\nin the university community.  This will increase the likelihood that a person in need of \\nservices will locate appropriate assistance.  Further, assure that office/person is well versed in all protocols established for the management of emergencies. \\nTrain key direct service mental health and \\ncounseling center personnel and first responders \\non the Illinois Mental Health Code and the requirements for involuntary hospitalization and \\ninvoluntary treatment. Further, take steps to assure that individuals receive post-\\nhospitalization follow up care to facilitate critically important continuity in treatment.   Train key staff and direct care personnel in the reporting requirements of the newly amended \\nFOID Act and identify procedures for forw\\narding required information to the State. \\nDevelop plans to secure crisis counselors \\nthat can be ﬁactivatedﬂ to support and augment \\npre-existing campus resources in the wake of a \\ncrisis.   Counselors can be identified both via local resources and through contacting the Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA) or the Illinois Department of Human Services, Division of Mental Health (DMH) and \\nshould have credentials vetted with the assi\\nstance of the Illinois Department of Public \\nHealth (IDPH). IEMA and DMH can assist with this process. \\nDevelop a plan for the management of volunteers who are deployed to a campus in the \\nwake of a crisis. This can be time consuming, and if not done well, can lead to chaos and \\ndisorganization while attempting to manage the crisis. \\nDevelop an alliance with governmental agencies\\n to determine all Federal and State resources \\nthat may be tapped for additional financial support for the university or college as they manage the crisis.  Typical sources of support fo\\nr mental health services may include but are \\nnot limited to Substance Abuse and Mental He\\nalth Services Agency (SAMHSA) grants and \\nDepartment of Justice grants.  Long-term support \\nfor mental health services is critical for persons who develop long-term and more serious disorders or refractory responses to stressful incidents.

Not all college and university staffers are \\naware of emergency response procedures or \\npolicies on exchange of information regarding potentially dangerous students.   Recommendations \\nColleges and universities need to clarify fo\\nr faculty and staff their roles, duties, and \\nresponsibilities under the Family Education Ri\\nghts and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) and \\nthe Mental Health and Developmental Di\\nsabilities Confidentiality Act (MHDDCA). \\nColleges and universities should develop and/or update response plans and processes, \\ndesignate appropriate points of contact, and ensure rapid response to legal issues arising \\nfrom a campus incident. \\nColleges and universities need to develop and/or update their campus policies covering: \\noThe type of information that can be exchanged between mental health providers and \\ncampus officials about students and campus personnel and the circumstances under \\nwhich such an exchange is appropriate;  oThe joint response plan between local la\\nw enforcement and the campus to address \\nemergencies on campus;  \\noThe inclusion of violence and threat of violence in the student code of conduct as \\nbehavior that may result in suspension, dism\\nissal, or expulsion and how a violation \\nof that standard may impact enrollment and/or housing status and appeal rights; \\noThe campus™ position regarding weapons on campus;  \\noThe intra-campus coordination of information sharing among campus housing, law \\nenforcement, health professionals, and administration, including who has access to \\nwhich information, delineating what level \\nof information can be shared with whom \\namongst campus emergency responders;  \\noThe identity of the lead agency in an emergency, recognizing that it may change \\ndepending on the nature of the emergency;  \\noThe contact people available for students and campus personnel in reporting a \\ndangerous or potentially dangerous person on campus; and  \\noThe new (effective June 1, 2008) standard\\n for involuntary civil commitment as it \\napplies to transport and/or removal of individuals from campus.  \\n    A-16\\nAPPENDI\\nX AŒS\\nTATE\\n OF ILLINOIS\\n CAMPUS\\n SECU\\nRIT\\nY TASK\\n FO\\nRCE\\n REPO\\nRT TO\\n THE GOVERNO\\nRAPPENDI\\nX AŒS\\nTATE\\n OF ILLINOIS\\n CAMPUS\\n SECU\\nRIT\\nY TASK\\n FO\\nRCE\\n REPO\\nRT TO\\n THE GOVERNO\\nR  \\n 3.\\nActions to Date  \\n CSTF has, prior to release of this report, take\\nn a series of actions designed to enhance campus \\nsecurity in Illinois.  Interoperable Radio Distribution At the Governor™s direction, the Illinois Terrorism Task Force and \\nMotorola, in a public-private partnership have provided 303 Starcom21 \\n700/800 MHz radios, including training\\n on their use, to 70 colleges and \\nuniversities throughout the State. \\nNorthern Illinois University received \\nthese radios prior to February 14, and utilized them during their \\nincident response on February 14. \\nThere are plans for further radio \\ndistributions to higher education partners in the coming months. Campus Security Awareness Training \\nThrough U. S. Department of Homeland Security funding \\nadministered by the Illinois Terrori\\nsm Task Force, campus security \\nawareness training has been provid\\ned at six regional sites throughout \\nIllinois. To date, 96 colleges and un\\niversities and 200 administrative \\nand security officials from these in\\nstitutions have taken advantage of \\nthis half-day course. Additional training sessions will be presented on \\nall-hazard campus safety preparedne\\nss beginning the summer of 2008. \\nMental Health Services Survey The Mental Health Services Team\\n of CSTF™s Prevention & Mental \\nHealth Committee conducted a comprehe\\nnsive survey of mental health \\nservices on higher education campuses in Illinois in an effort to \\nstimulate a statewide discussion on the adequacy of mental health \\nservices on college campuses in the context of a growing need for such \\nservices. The survey achieved a response rate of 61%. Its results have \\nbeen used to develop several recommendations which, when \\nimplemented, could enhance service access for individuals with mental \\nor emotional difficulties.

The tragic\\n events at NIU make implementation of these \\ntwo initiatives vital to Illinois campus security. \\n\\n \\nIt is the strong recommendation of the Campus Security Task \\nForce that the legislature pass and the Governor enact and implement: \\n1)2008 Campus Security Enhancement Act; and\\n 2)\\nThe Campus Security Enhancement Grant Pr\\nogram, as a part of the Governor™s \\nproposed Capital Bill.\\n  \\nInitiative Details: 2008 Campus Security Enhancement Act   All Illinois higher education institutions* shall be required to: 1.\\nDevelop, train and exercise at minimum annu\\nally a NIMS compliant, all-hazards emergency \\nresponse plan in partnership with and reported to their county or major municipal \\nemergency management official, and; \\n2.\\nDevelop, train and exercise at minimum \\nannually an inter-disciplinary and multi-\\njurisdictional campus violence prevention \\nplan, including coordination of and \\ncommunication between all available campus and local mental health and first response \\nresources, in partnership with and reported to their county or major municipal emergency \\nmanagement official. The campus violence prev\\nention plan shall include the development \\nand implementation of a campus violence prevention committee and campus threat \\nassessment team.  3.\\nCounty and major municipal emergency manage\\nrs and IEMA regional coordinators shall \\nassist in the planning and training process for \\nthese two plans with all resources available to \\nthem.  County emergency managers and IEMA \\nregional coordinators shall provide higher \\neducation institutions with appropriate standards \\nand guidelines for these plans, training and \\nexercises.   NOTE Œ The Act could be added as a sub-s\\nection of Chapter 110 (Higher Education), \\nGeneral Provisions Sections, of Illinois Comp\\niled Statutes (2008), and other relevant \\nsections of public university enabling legislation.  NOTE Œ The Campus Security Task Force™s \\nReport provides detailed guidance on the \\ndevelopment and implementation of these required plans, and includes recommendations \\nfor resources to assist schools in their development.  * Higher Education Institutions = 12 public un\\niversities; 48 community colleges; 94 independent \\nnot-for-profit; and 29 independent for-profit institutions; Total = 183 \\n APPENDI\\nX AŒS\\nTATE\\n OF ILLINOIS\\n CAMPUS\\n SECU\\nRIT\\nY TASK\\n FO\\nRCE\\n REPO\\nRT TO\\n THE GOVERNO\\nRA-21\\nAPPENDI\\nX AŒS\\nTATE\\n OF ILLINOIS\\n CAMPUS\\n SECU\\nRIT\\nY TASK\\n FO\\nRCE\\n REPO\\nRT TO\\n THE GOVERNO\\nR  \\n Campus Security Enhancement Grant Program  \\n Overview: $25 million proposed in the Governor™s FY09 Capital Bill  oSEE: Capital Budget Book, P.60, Appendix A \\nFiscal Agent / Administrator = IEMA  It is the consensus of the Campus Security Task For\\nce that, if approved, thes\\ne funds be expended in \\nfour key parts.

Enhancing interagency \\nand multi-jurisdictional cooperation will be cr\\nitical to future emergency response. Those \\nenhancements will require that responding agenci\\nes and jurisdictions have the capability to \\nefficiently and effectively communicate with each other in the event of a crisis. \\n \\nEnhancing interoperability has two components.  \\nOne of those components is to enhance the \\ntechnical capabilities to work together.  The seco\\nnd component is to develop a common operating \\nframework for emergency response.  The State has \\nundertaken steps to do both with respect to its \\ncolleges and universities. \\n \\nWith respect to technology, the Illinois Terrorism Task Force (ITTF) and Motorola, in a public-\\n\\nprivate partnership, provided 303 Starcom21 700/\\n800 MHz radios to 70 colleges and universities \\nthroughout the State (see Attachme\\nnt A Œ College Radio Training).\\n4  \\nTraining on how to use the radios also was prov\\nided by the Illinois Emergency Management Agency \\n(IEMA) to the colleges and universities that r\\neceived the interoperable communications equipment. \\nStarcom21 is the name given to the statewide in\\nteroperable communications system utilized by the \\nIllinois State Police and other State and local public safety agencies.\\n5 The ITTF previously had \\ndistributed more than 2,800 of these radios \\nto public safety agencies throughout the State.\\n6 This \\nwidespread distribution provides a foundation \\nfor statewide interoperable communications as \\noutlined in the Illinois Statewide Communicati\\nons Interoperability Plan, which recently was \\napproved by the United States Department of Homeland Security\\n7. For these colleges and \\nuniversities, the Starcom21 radios provide not on\\nly those critical on-campus voice communications \\nlinks between campus security and campus administrators\\n, but also, in most cases, a critical link to \\noff-campus response agencies such as local police, fire and emergency management. \\n\\n \\nWith respect to creating a common operating \\nframework, the State has adopted the National \\nIncident Management System (NIMS)\\n8 as the template for emergency response statewide.

NI\\nMS provides a common operating framework for \\nall responders.  As the NRF notes regarding NIMS:  This system provides a consistent, nationwide template to enable Federal, State, \\ntribal, and local governments, the private sector, and non-governmental \\norganizations (NGOs) to work together to prepare for, prevent, respond to, recover \\n\\nfrom, and mitigate the effects of incidents regardless of cause, size, location, or \\n\\ncomplexity. This consistency provides the foundation for utilization of the \\nNIMS \\nfor all incidents, ranging from daily occurr\\nences to incidents requiring a coordinated \\nFederal response.\\n10\\n   By adopting NIMS consistent with the NRF, colle\\nges and universities will align their response \\nstructures with those of supporting State and local agencies.  This will allow for clearer \\ncommunication and easier cooperation in the event of an emergency.  It will also allow colleges and \\n\\nuniversities to tap into a wealth of State and Federa\\nl training resources.  Many\\n of these resources are \\noffered at no charge through the Federal Emerge\\nncy Management Agency.  For example, online \\ntraining in NIMS is available for first responders at\\n no charge.  This training\\n would also be available \\nto college and university administrators at no charge\\n.  Such training would familiarize the college and \\nuniversity systems with the requirements of em\\nergency response from the highest levels of \\nadministration to first responders on the scene.  It\\n would also align college and university systems \\nwith the response from a variety of other local, State and Federal agencies as well as private \\n\\norganizations like the Red Cross and Salvation Army.  \\n Recommendations \\nColleges and universities should ensure that all agen\\ncies that are or may be involved in the response \\nto an emergency on their campuses are trained in\\n NIMS, which should form the common operating \\nstructure for any response. All key decision makers at a college or university should be familiar with \\nNIMS.11\\n  Colleges and universities should make development and implementation of interoperable \\ncommunications among response agencies a cen\\ntral focus of campus emergency planning. \\nCommunications plans should be regularly tested\\n. The statewide StarCom21 system provides a \\nmechanism for colleges and universities to coordinate response activities with outside public safety \\nagencies.   Finding \\n\\nA strong system of unified command and control of \\nan incident is essential for the concentration of \\nresources necessary to mitigate threats to life and pr\\noperty. This fact is clearly recognized in NIMS.  \\nAs a framework for command and control, NIMS\\n suggests the employment of the Incident \\nCommand System (ICS) to address emergency response.  As noted in the findings above, NIMS and \\n\\nthe ICS are the established best practices across the nation for addressing emergency response \\n\\n\\n\\n http://www.fema.gov/pdf/e\\nmergency/nrf/nrf-core.pdf\\n  10\\n Ibid. \\nhttp://www.whitehouse.gov/new\\ns/releases/2003/02/20030228-9.html; \\nhttp://training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/IS/i\\ns700.asp; http://oep.osophs\\n.dhhs.gov/ccrf/NIMS_t\\nraining.htm                        \\n A-26\\nAPPENDI\\nX AŒS\\nTATE\\n OF ILLINOIS\\n CAMPUS\\n SECU\\nRIT\\nY TASK\\n FO\\nRCE\\n REPO\\nRT TO\\n THE GOVERNO\\nRAPPENDI\\nX AŒS\\nTATE\\n OF ILLINOIS\\n CAMPUS\\n SECU\\nRIT\\nY TASK\\n FO\\nRCE\\n REPO\\nRT TO\\n THE GOVERNO\\nR  \\n   4 operations.  Just as with NIMS, adoption of the IC\\nS structure by colleges and universities for their \\nemergency response will allow for smooth integration of\\n support services from \\nother local, State and \\nFederal agencies.  The adoption of ICS will also a\\nllow colleges and universities to tap into a wide \\npool of training resources on ICS that are offered \\nin conjunction with the Federal promotion of the \\nNIMS.  \\n Recommendation Colleges and universities should adopt the ICS model, delineated in NIMS, as the basis for \\ncommand and control in the event of an emerge\\nncy.  All first responders and key college and \\nuniversity personnel should be familiar with ICS.   Finding \\n\\nAn all-hazards approach to planning is quickly becoming the standard in the field of emergency \\n\\nresponse. Development of strong all-hazards emer\\ngency plans will allow campuses to more quickly \\nrespond to all natural and manmade emergency situat\\nions. Having a comprehensive plan in place to \\nrespond to risks and hazards facing a college or university can help mitigate the consequences of \\n\\nincidents.12\\n    \\nThe importance of planning can hardly be overstated as the NRF notes: \\n Planning provides three principal bene\\nfits: (1) it allows jurisdictions to \\ninfluence the course of events in an emergency by determining in advance \\n\\nthe actions, policies, and processes that \\nwill be followed; (2) it guides other \\npreparedness activities; and (3) it contributes to unity of effort by providing \\na common blueprint for activity in the event of an emergency. Planning is a \\nfoundational element of both preparedness and response and thus is an \\n\\nessential homeland security activity. Emergency planning is a national \\npriority, as reflected in the \\nNational Preparedness Guidelines\\n. [footnote \\nomitted]\\n13\\n  The development of planning based on an all-haza\\nrds approach will align colleges and universities \\nwith the planning protocols employed by the Stat\\ne and allow college and university planners to tap \\ninto a wide range of resources. \\n \\nThe State has already recognized the importance of planning with respect to educational institutions \\n\\nfor K-12 students.  K-12 schools in Illinois must, by\\n law, have all-hazard plans and hold regular \\nexercises of those plans, but no such legislation exists with regard to Illinois colleges and \\n\\nuniversities.\\n14\\n While many colleges and universities do ha\\nve such plans, the committee thinks it \\nwould be prudent to have legislation requiring all \\ncolleges and universities to develop and maintain \\nall-hazard plans. The suggestion of the Respons\\ne Committee is for the Illinois Board of Higher \\nEducation to draft such legislation.  \\n\\n \\n \\n12Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Developm\\nent of all-hazard plans should be statutorily \\nrequired and those plans should be exercised annu\\nally. The all-hazards planning process requires \\nassessment of the needs of all relevant stake\\nholders, including students, faculty and staff.   Finding \\n\\nTraining and exercise of emergency response plan\\ns and systems are a necessary part of emergency \\npreparedness. Plans that are not accompanied by suppor\\ntive training and exerci\\nsing are of little help \\nin the event of an emergency. Illinois™ emerge\\nncy management community, including IEMA and \\nITTF, along with the rest of the nation, has long \\nrecognized the importance of training and exercise \\nfor emergency preparedness. \\n\\n \\nTraining resources have already been extended to\\n the university and college communities. Through \\nU. S. Department of Homeland Security funding \\nadministered by the ITTF, training has been \\nprovided at six regional sites throughout the State.\\n To date, 96 colleges and universities and 200 \\nadministrative and security officials from these inst\\nitutions have taken advantage of this half-day \\ncourse (see Appendix A Œ Part \\nII). Additional training sessions w\\nill be presented on all-hazard \\ncampus safety preparedness beginning the summer of 2008.15\\n  \\nThe course is a college/university adaptation \\nof the nationally recognized K-12 school safety \\ntraining that the ITTF has been\\n sponsoring throughout the State.\\n10\\n A review committee of experts \\nrepresenting all three of CSTF™s committees assis\\nted in the development of this course by a \\nrecognized national expert, who modified the K-12 curriculum for colleges and universities. The \\n\\ncourse includes information on how to identify and plan for all types of hazards, including preparing \\n\\nemergency management plans, developing procedur\\nes to respond to and recover from a crisis, \\ntraining personnel in their roles during such a \\nresponse and exercising those emergency plans.\\n11\\n  \\nAs noted above, the legislation \\nthat created planning requirement\\ns for K-12 schools also required \\nthe exercise of those plans.  There is no reas\\non that similar requirements should not apply to \\ncolleges and universities.    \\n\\n \\nOne final issue with respect to training involves \\nthe roles and responsibilities of persons other than \\nthe first responders.  Just as we expect all citizens\\n to play a role in emergency preparedness in their \\ncommunities, students, faculty, and staff have role\\ns and responsibilities with respect to emergency \\nresponse in their academic communities.  In the \\nexperience of emergency response professionals, a \\nwell trained populace is an important ally in mitigati\\nng consequence in the event of an emergency.  \\n\\nThus, information and training about individual \\nresponsibilities and actions in the event of an \\nemergency are important.  \\n Recommendations \\nColleges and universities should take steps to se\\ne that their campus first responders, who will be \\nrelied upon in the execution of their all-hazard \\nplans, are appropriately trained and exercised.  \\nIllinois Board of Higher Education.  ﬁIllinois Board of Hi\\ngher Education, All-Hazard \\nEmergency Planning, Regional \\nSession Summary.ﬂ  2007. \\n A-28\\nAPPENDI\\nX AŒS\\nTATE\\n OF ILLINOIS\\n CAMPUS\\n SECU\\nRIT\\nY TASK\\n FO\\nRCE\\n REPO\\nRT TO\\n THE GOVERNO\\nRAPPENDI\\nX AŒS\\nTATE\\n OF ILLINOIS\\n CAMPUS\\n SECU\\nRIT\\nY TASK\\n FO\\nRCE\\n REPO\\nRT TO\\n THE GOVERNO\\nR  \\n   6 Colleges and universities should ensure that students, faculty and staff are informed regarding their \\nroles and responsibilities in preparing for and responding to emergency situations.  \\n  Finding \\n\\nThe ability of campus security and/or campus administ\\nrators to get timely emergency notifications \\nto students, faculty and staff was one of the focal points of the studies on what happened at Virginia \\n\\nTech, where, for a variety of reasons, notification t\\nook more than two hours from the time of the \\n\\nfirst shooting.\\n16\\n Development of robust and redundant internal communication systems that reach \\nstudents, faculty, and staff can expedite disse\\nmination of important, sometimes life-saving, \\ninformation.   \\n \\nBecause the communication of a hazard or threat to everyone on campus is such a critical \\n\\ncomponent of mitigating an emergency incident, \\nestablished communications protocols suggest that \\na multi-tiered approach should be used.\\n17\\n No single technology or medi\\num will be effective for all \\npersons in all circumstances. With respect to a \\nmulti-tiered approach, redundant methods of \\ncommunication should be employed.

Sadly informed by\\n the tragic experiences at Virginia Tech and \\nNorthern Illinois universities, these recommendations are not meant to provide all answers that may \\n\\narise in discussions of campus security in the contex\\nt of mental health concerns, but rather should \\n\\nstimulate ongoing dialogue that must occur on each\\n campus as administrators and policymakers alike \\ncontemplate opportunities to improv\\ne our emergency management and mental health systems.  The \\nultimate outcome anticipated by the following r\\necommendations is to create healthier learning \\nenvironments for our students and campus families,\\n and to do all in our power to prevent these \\ntragedies from ever visiting another student, another family, another campus.    \\n\\n \\nThe following recommendations are targeted to all un\\niversities and colleges in the State and point to \\nbroad areas for improvement.  It was clearl\\ny understood by Task Force members that \\ncollege/university size, mission or other consid\\nerations may preclude the adopting of all \\nrecommendations herein; however, each institution \\nshould give serious consideration to the issues \\npresented, understanding their relevance to assuring both campus safety and individual well-being.   \\n\\n \\nFinding \\n The Need to Create Healthy Campus Cultures while Promoting Awareness and Prevention  \\nThe social stigma associated with mental illness remains a significant barrier to accessing needed \\n\\nservices.  This holds true on college campuses that\\n not only are in many ways microcosms of our \\nlarger society but also are associated with a unique\\n set of life stressors \\nincluding separation from \\ntraditional social supports, living in a new environm\\nent, directly confronting issues of diversity for \\nthe first time, new expectations around academic \\nperformance, and managing the cost of higher \\neducation, to name a few.    \\n\\n \\nTask Force members stressed the need to promote cultures of mutual respect, trust, sharing and \\n\\nopenness on college campuses to achieve several goals:  \\n\\n \\n1)\\nReduce the sense of isolation that may be\\n associated with college transition;  \\n2)\\nNormalize help seeking behavior for those who pos\\ne a threat to themselves or others or who \\nsimply are suffering in some way and need assistance;  \\n3)\\nEliminate tacit ﬁcodes of silenceﬂ Œ beliefs that\\n it is not acceptable to seek help for persons \\nengaging in troublesome behavior Œ codes th\\nat when adopted may impede identifying and \\nresponding to those in crisis;  \\n4)\\nTo establish a campus policy for zero tolerance for violence of any kind perpetrated against any \\n\\nmember of the campus community.  This zero tole\\nrance policy would also be inclusive of verbal \\n A-36\\nAPPENDI\\nX AŒS\\nTATE\\n OF ILLINOIS\\n CAMPUS\\n SECU\\nRIT\\nY TASK\\n FO\\nRCE\\n REPO\\nRT TO\\n THE GOVERNO\\nRAPPENDI\\nX AŒS\\nTATE\\n OF ILLINOIS\\n CAMPUS\\n SECU\\nRIT\\nY TASK\\n FO\\nRCE\\n REPO\\nRT TO\\n THE GOVERNO\\nR  \\n 14 \\nthreats and ﬁbullyingﬂ behavior that may be es\\npecially problematic for at-risk members of the \\ncampus community. \\n Task Force members also focused on the importance of prevention and awareness through \\n\\neducation and training on the early signs and sy\\nmptoms of distress and mental illness and on \\nviolence prevention. Education and training should \\nbe made available to a wide audience, including \\nfaculty, staff, students, families, and first res\\nponders.   These activities can facilitate early \\nintervention for members of the campus community \\nneeding assistance and ultimately reduce the \\nlikelihood of violent incidents on campus.   \\n \\nDeveloping the capacity to conduct an assessment of\\n the seriousness or viability of a threat reported \\non the campus was deemed by Task Force members to be an important strategy to reduce the \\n\\nlikelihood of violent incidents.  Task Force member\\ns were clear that considerable caution should be \\nexercised in developing policies and approaches fo\\nr the conduct of threat assessments to reduce the \\npossibility that persons with mental illness or simply\\n those in need of discus\\nsing emotional concerns \\nare not targeted for or subjected to unnecessary or \\nunfair surveillance.  Conversely, the United States \\nSecret Service and the United St\\nates Department of Education\\n3 support a ﬁfact-basedﬂ approach \\nthat focuses on behaviors as key indicators of\\n potential violence as opposed to profiling or \\nstereotyping individuals.    \\n Recommendations: Develop culturally and linguistically appropria\\nte messages to de-stigmatize mental illness as \\nwell as other illnesses, while normalizing all attem\\npts to seek assistance and treatment for self \\nand for others.  Teach that ﬁcodes of silenceﬂ\\n or keeping silent about a person™s pain or \\ndistress may lead to negative outcomes. \\nExpand both formal and informal opportunities\\n for entering students to integrate into the \\ncampus community with the goals of establishing\\n viable social networks and reducing social \\nisolation. Provide collaborative training opportunities on si\\ngns, symptoms and early identification of \\nmental illness or other behavioral patterns th\\nat may be predictive of violence, on violence \\nprevention strategies, and on response protoc\\nols for a variety of potential incidents. \\nResearch has indicated that the risk of viol\\nence may increase when other risk factors are \\npresent, such as substance abuse, lack of personal supports and exposure to destabilizers.  \\nTraining should be targeted to campus security \\nforces and first responders, health services \\npersonnel, counselors, resident advisors, coaches, and student/minority affairs staff.   \\nWidely distribute and/or facilitate access to \\nawareness and prevention information on early \\nsigns of mental illness and the importance \\nof seeking help, violence prevention, and \\nsubstance abuse awareness and prevention.  C\\nonsider incorporating existing anti-stigma \\ncampaigns (SAMHSA™s ﬁWhat a Difference a Fr\\niend Makesﬂ campaign, Illinois Department \\nof Human Services™ ﬁSay it Out Loudﬂ campaign) \\ninto faculty, student and staff orientations \\nand campus life programs (See Appendix B, Parts I-IV).\\n18\\n Develop non-discriminatory campus policie\\ns that promote awareness and prevention \\nactivities.

The purpose of the team is both \\ninvestigational and interventional.  Teams should\\n be multidisciplinary in composition, must \\nhave a senior clinical staff member as well as representation from Student Affairs and \\ncampus security, and should meet with some regularity. Policy considerations must be \\ncareful not to erode the rights of persons in n\\need or create additional barriers to treatment.  \\nTask Force members strongly advise consulting expert guidance in establishing policies and \\nprocedures for this team (See Appendix B, Part VI). \\n   \\nFinding \\n The Need to Assure Access to an Array of Time\\nly and Appropriate Mental Health Services \\n \\nResearch has indicated that incidences of several \\ndisorders are increasing amongst college students, \\nincluding substance abuse, eating disorders an\\nd more severe psychopathology including bipolar \\ndisorder, major depressive disorder and anxiety diso\\nrders.  Further, a grow\\ning number of college \\nstudents have been prescribed psychotropic medications increasing from 9% in 1994 to 25% in \\n\\n2006.\\n5 However, college and university campuses report \\nvarying degrees of preparedness to address \\nthe mental health needs of their students.   The \\nMental Health Services Team of the Task Force \\nconducted a survey of mental health services on\\n college campuses in an effort to stimulate a \\n\\nstatewide discussion on the adequacy of mental heal\\nth services on college campuses in the context \\nof a growing need for such services.   Task\\n Force members highly recommend collaboration \\nbetween the university and local comm\\nunity mental health service provid\\ners to address existing gaps.  \\nSurvey results are appended and include several recommendations that specifically offer guidance \\n\\nthat could ultimately enhance service access for indivi\\nduals with mental or emotional difficulties (See \\nAppendix B, Part VII). \\n \\nTask Force members point to the \\nimportance, again, of ensuring \\nthat key university personnel are \\nadequately trained in early identification of mental\\n disorders and crisis management and also well \\n\\nversed on the Illinois Mental Health and Deve\\nlopmental Disabilities Code, 405 ILCS 5/1 \\net seq.\\n that \\naddresses circumstances under which involuntary co\\nmmitment, and involuntary treatment should be \\nconsidered. Key personnel also should be awar\\ne of recent changes in the Firearm Owners \\nIdentification Card Act 430 ILCS 65/1 \\net seq\\n. that addresses requirements \\nof clinicians to report to \\nthe State the identity of persons who could pose \\na danger and should be restricted from the \\npurchase of firearms.  Such trai\\nning is available through the State; however, other experts are quite \\n\\ncapable of providing guidance in this area. \\n\\n \\nAddressing the needs of individuals in crisis is \\nfundamental to their safety and well being as well as \\nthe safety of the campus.  Assuring availability \\nof immediate intervention either through crisis \\nintervention teams on campus, or through immedia\\nte referral and linkage to community resources, is \\ndeemed critical. \\n\\n Recommendations: Use the International Association of Counseling Services (IACS) Guidelines for best \\npractices in providing mental health services\\n.

The \\nIllinois Department of Human Services, Division of Mental Health (DMH) can assist in \\nbrokering these agreements. Attempt to eliminate all waiting lists for se\\nrvices by increasing personnel on campus or \\nthrough relationships with community and \\ncontractual providers.  Technology (e.g., \\ntelemedicine, telepsychiatry) may be useful in in\\ncreasing access, especially in rural areas.  Assure that all persons experiencing a mental\\n health crisis have access to immediate \\nintervention in order to determine level of care\\n needed and specifically to assess degree of \\ndanger to self and others.  Consider implementing crisis intervention teams on campus, \\nstaffed with individuals well versed in mental health crisis management. \\nIdentify an office or person responsible for \\nproviding mental health counseling referral \\ninformation for students and employees and make certain that office/person is well known \\nin the university community.  This will increa\\nse the likelihood that a person in need of \\nservices will locate appropriate assistance.  Fu\\nrther, assure that office/person is well versed \\nin all protocols established for the management of emergencies. \\nTrain key direct service mental health and co\\nunseling center personnel and first responders \\non the Illinois Mental Health Code and the requi\\nrements for involuntary hospitalization and \\ninvoluntary treatment. Further, take steps to assure that individuals receive post-\\nhospitalization follow up care to facilitate critically important continuity in treatment.   Train key staff and direct care personnel in the reporting requirements of the newly amended \\nFOID Act and identify procedures for forw\\narding required information to the State. \\n  Finding \\n The Need to Plan for Securing and Managing Addi\\ntional Clinical Support Services as part of \\nthe University Crisis Management Protocol  One task not anticipated by universities and colleges in planning emergency response protocols is \\n\\nthe need for the immediate deployment of possibl\\ny large numbers of crisis counselors or other \\nmental health professionals.  The following recommendations have been informed by the recent \\n\\nexperiences of the administrators at Northern\\n Illinois University who expertly managed these \\n\\nchallenges which are often overlooked.   \\n   APPENDI\\nX AŒS\\nTATE\\n OF ILLINOIS\\n CAMPUS\\n SECU\\nRIT\\nY TASK\\n FO\\nRCE\\n REPO\\nRT TO\\n THE GOVERNO\\nRA-39\\nAPPENDI\\nX AŒS\\nTATE\\n OF ILLINOIS\\n CAMPUS\\n SECU\\nRIT\\nY TASK\\n FO\\nRCE\\n REPO\\nRT TO\\n THE GOVERNO\\nR  \\n 17 \\nRecommendations: Develop plans to secure crisis counselors that can be ﬁactivatedﬂ to support and augment \\npre-existing campus resources in the wake of a \\ncrisis.   Counselors can be identified both via \\nlocal resources and through contacting the \\nIllinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA) \\nor the Illinois Department of Human Servi\\nces, Division of Mental Health (DMH) and \\nshould have credentials vetted with the assi\\nstance of the Illinois Department of Public \\nHealth (IDPH). IEMA and DMH can assist with this process. \\nDevelop a plan for the management of volun\\nteers who are deployed to a campus in the \\nwake of a crisis. This can be time consuming,\\n and if not done well, can lead to chaos and \\ndisorganization while attempting to manage the crisis. \\nDevelop an alliance with governmental agencies\\n to determine all Federal and State resources \\nthat may be tapped for additional financial sup\\nport for the university or college as they \\nmanage the crisis.  Typical sources of support fo\\nr mental health services may include but are \\nnot limited to Substance Abuse and Mental He\\nalth Services Agency (SAMHSA) grants and \\nDepartment of Justice grants.  Long-term support \\nfor mental health services is critical for \\npersons who develop long-term and more serious disorders or refractory responses to \\nstressful incidents.

This \\nprocess began by thoroughly reviewing numerous St\\nate and Federal laws.  Focusing on the intersection \\nof higher education and the Illinois Mental Health \\nand Developmental Disabilities Confidentiality Act \\n(MHDDCA) (740 ILCS 110 et seq.), Family Educati\\non Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) (20 \\nUSCA, Section 1232(g)), Americans with Disabiliti\\nes Act of 1990 (ADA) (42 USC, Section 12131, \\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act \\nof 1996 (HIPAA) (C.F.R., Section 160.103) and the \\nClery Act (20 USC, Section 1092(f)).   \\n\\n \\nThe Legal Committee understood that Campus Security \\nTask Force (CSTF) members were significantly \\nconcerned with legal barriers to information exch\\nange on campuses, and therefore spent much time \\nanalyzing FERPA and MHDDCA, specifically the provis\\nions relevant to release of information about \\ndangerous or potentially dangerous students.   As\\n deliverables for CSTF the Legal Committee developed \\ndetailed summaries of the Mental Health and Deve\\nlopmental Disabilities Confidentiality Act and the \\nFamily Educational Rights and Privacy Act. Thes\\ne documents will serve as reference materials for \\ncampus counsel and other personnel.  These summaries provide detailed descriptions of portions of \\n\\nthese Acts, including relevant exceptions and guidance on interpretation. \\n\\n  \\nThe Virginia Tech and Northern Illinois University tr\\nagedies, and many subsequent reports and findings \\nillustrate the challenges and perceived barriers ca\\nmpuses confront in responding to potentially \\ndangerous students while complying with student \\nprivacy protections.  The following are the Campus \\nSecurity Task Force Legal Committee™s findings and recommendations: \\n\\n \\nFinding\\n A challenge is the perception that Federal education \\nand State mental health privacy laws prohibit the \\nexchange of information among campus officials in responding to a potentially dangerous student.    \\nSpecific exceptions exist in FERPA that allow for \\nthe exchange of student information with other \\nschool officials, including faculty who have a legitima\\nte educational interest in the information to fulfill \\ntheir professional responsibilities.  Additionally, a \\nconsiderable amount of student information and \\ndocuments exist that do not fall within the defini\\ntion of educational record and therefore can be \\n\\ndisclosed.  Such information may include law en\\nforcement records and first-hand observations of \\ncampus personnel, for example, a verbal report from a \\nprofessor about a potentially dangerous student.  \\nSimilarly, there are exceptions in the IMHDDCA th\\nat allow for release of some mental health \\ninformation.  The Legal Committee provided su\\nmmaries and interpretation of both FERPA and \\nIMHDDCA exceptions. \\n\\n Recommendation Campuses should develop, clarify or update inform\\nation release policies.  Campuses should include \\ntraining for all staff \\non FERPA and the campus information sharing policies.  Campus officials \\nshould be encouraged to consult their attorneys\\n or counsel™s office with specific questions on \\n A-46\\nAPPENDI\\nX AŒS\\nTATE\\n OF ILLINOIS\\n CAMPUS\\n SECU\\nRIT\\nY TASK\\n FO\\nRCE\\n REPO\\nRT TO\\n THE GOVERNO\\nRAPPENDI\\nX AŒS\\nTATE\\n OF ILLINOIS\\n CAMPUS\\n SECU\\nRIT\\nY TASK\\n FO\\nRCE\\n REPO\\nRT TO\\n THE GOVERNO\\nR24 \\nreleasing student information.  Relevant camp\\nus personnel should be made aware of IMHDDCA \\nexceptions allowing release of pati\\nent mental health information. \\n  \\nFinding \\n\\nSome CSTF members expressed a desire for a standard\\nized guide for response to potentially dangerous \\n\\nstudents.  However, each campus is geographically and structurally unique, and campus response \\n\\nprotocols and responses will be different across the State. \\n\\n Recommendation Campuses should develop or update processes to respond to a potentially dangerous student.  \\nCampuses may develop a response team that can rapidly respond to a potentially dangerous student \\nscenario and emerging legal questions.  Campuses are encouraged to designate a primary point of \\ncontact for campus officials and faculty to contac\\nt regarding a dangerous or potentially dangerous \\nperson on campus.  All personnel must be made \\naware of the appropriate point of contact and \\ndecision maker, whether it is one individual or a coordinated response team. \\n  Finding \\n\\nNot all campus staff or faculty ar\\ne aware of campus policies on emer\\ngency response and exchange of \\ninformation in dangerous or potentially dangerous situations.   \\n \\nMost CSTF members report that their campus has an \\nemergency response plan in place.  Most CSTF \\nLegal Committee members report that their campus ha\\ns policies in place regarding FERPA and other \\ncommunications of student information.  And yet, \\nmany college and university personnel do not seem \\nto have the necessary information \\nabout emergency response and exchan\\nge of information in dangerous \\nor potentially dangerous situations. \\n Recommendation Campuses should distribute information and train personnel about their emergency response \\npolicies. Campus counsel should clarify State and Federal laws for necessary personnel, including \\nvarious exceptions that allow release of information.  Campuses can distribute the Legal \\nCommittee™s guidance to appropriate personnel.

While the \\nincident represents the worst kind of tragedy, \\nNIU™s response represents, to date, an effective \\nmodel for all-hazards emergency planning, response \\nand recovery on a higher education campus. In addition, the Campus Security Task Force can \\n\\nconclude that observations made and best practices identified through the recent incident at NIU \\n\\nserve to amplify and confirm the validity and \\nimportance of the Task Force™s Report to the \\nGovernor \\n \\nPlease note that all mentions of times of events\\n in the summary below are approximate and are not \\nbased on any official findings. \\n \\nPlanning & Training \\n\\n \\nNIU™s philosophy towards emergency response recognizes that \\nplanning is important, but \\ninsufficient without training \\nand exercises \\nThe goal of all planning must be to ensure effective execution of response and recovery \\nduring an incident. \\nAll planning and training must be conducted\\n in partnership with all relevant campus, \\nsurrounding-community, local and State partners. \\nEmergency incident planning must emphasize: \\noLeadership Œ Clear goals, objectives, \\nand equal footing for all partners; \\noﬁFollowshipﬂ Œ Disciplined, well exercised re\\nsponse; avoidance of ﬁfirst impulseﬂ by \\nresponders, and a clear, well-organized ch\\nain-of-command, with assigned roles and \\ndelegated responsibilities; oRelationships Œ Response leaders from a campus and its surrounding community \\n\\nmust know each other and train with one another before an incident occurs. \\n\\nResponse leaders must also know the \\nmembers of their community before an \\nincident occurs. NIU utilizes a network of\\n Campus Safety Centers set-up throughout \\nits campus, including its residence halls, \\nso that campus police build rapport with \\nstudents, faculty and staff, and ensure effective communication channels and \\n\\nexpectations during an emergency.  \\nNIU™s planning, training, and exercises, as part\\n of a comprehensive, all-hazards approach to \\ndealing with campus emergencies, most likely saved lives on February 14, 2008. \\n \\nNIU places great importance on interdis\\nciplinary, multi-jurisdictional training and exercises to enhance response \\nAll high-level campus administrators and manage\\nrs conduct at least one simulation per year \\nto review their roles, duties and protocols during an incident. \\nCampus security police also conduct their own \\nsimulations and training, often involving \\nmulti-jurisdictional and interdisciplinary response. \\n APPENDI\\nX AŒS\\nTATE\\n OF ILLINOIS\\n CAMPUS\\n SECU\\nRIT\\nY TASK\\n FO\\nRCE\\n REPO\\nRT TO\\n THE GOVERNO\\nRA-53\\nAPPENDI\\nX AŒS\\nTATE\\n OF ILLINOIS\\n CAMPUS\\n SECU\\nRIT\\nY TASK\\n FO\\nRCE\\n REPO\\nRT TO\\n THE GOVERNO\\nR31 \\nNIU emphasizes that planning must start early, training must occur often, and that \\nrelationships between and among all key disciplin\\nes and community partners be built over \\ntime. NIU has created an Office of Emergency Mana\\ngement that is sta\\nffed full-time by well \\neducated and trained individuals whose sole\\n commitment is to emergency management \\nplanning and preparedness efforts for the camp\\nus. Plans are reviewed and updated regularly \\nbased on exercises and incidents. The university develops an incident action pl\\nan for multiple contingencies, using that \\nframework to respond to any size incident. \\n EMT Training \\nAll NIU campus police officers are traine\\nd as non-transport Emergency Medical \\nTechnicians. During the incident this ensured\\n almost immediate start of medical treatment \\nfor the injured. NIU has recognized a need fo\\nr such EMT training to guarantee the entry of \\nmedical response personnel even in an active \\nshooter situation by the cross-training of \\narmed campus police. EMT training also ensures that NIU campus police can bridge the \\n\\ntime-gap between the occurrence of an injury\\n and the arrival of full paramedic/ambulance \\nunits.  EMT training is conducted at local community co\\nlleges and hospitals. Some officers are fully \\ntrained paramedics, while, again, all others are trained as non-transport EMTs. \\nEMT kits, including all essential response tools,\\n are strategically located across the entire \\ncampus as well as in all campus police cars.  \\nActive Shooter Training \\nAll NIU campus police are trained to respond to active shooter incidents. \\nAll NIU campus police are armed to ensure effective response to any violent incident. Training emphasizes that officers cannot and s\\nhould not wait for an actual tactical response \\nteam to arrive on scene before responding to an active shooter. After the shooting at \\n\\nColumbine H.S. in Colorado, most police agencies\\n adopted a tactic to have the first three or \\nfour officers on scene make entry in a diamond \\nformation. NIU officers are trained that the \\nfirst officer on scene should make immediate entry. \\nNIU campus police train to avoid having mult\\niple response teams entering from different \\nentry ways, in order to avoid crossfire. During \\nthe incident this training prevented multiple \\npoint entry and crossfire. \\nNIU campus police utilize body armor and rece\\nntly acquired ﬁbody bunkersﬂ providing \\nadditional armor for officers in tactical situations. \\nNIU campus police performed a sweep on Februa\\nry 14 of Cole Hall and two adjacent halls \\nto ensure there were no secondary shooters or wounded. \\n \\nResponse \\n\\n \\nQuick Response Times The first campus police arrived on scene within \\n30 seconds after the initial call for service \\nbecause of the close proximity to the incident of a particular officer. \\nNIU officials did share with CSTF their timelin\\ne of response. Those details are as follows \\n(Please note that all times are approxima\\nte and not based on official findings):  A-54\\nAPPENDI\\nX AŒS\\nTATE\\n OF ILLINOIS\\n CAMPUS\\n SECU\\nRIT\\nY TASK\\n FO\\nRCE\\n REPO\\nRT TO\\n THE GOVERNO\\nRAPPENDI\\nX AŒS\\nTATE\\n OF ILLINOIS\\n CAMPUS\\n SECU\\nRIT\\nY TASK\\n FO\\nRCE\\n REPO\\nRT TO\\n THE GOVERNO\\nR32 \\no3:06 pm - First call regarding an active shooter comes to the NIU  \\ndispatch center indicating shooter at Cole Hall; \\no3:06:29 pm - First NIU campus police of\\nficer arrives at Cole Hall coming  \\nfrom adjacent parking lot; o3:07 pm - Two more NIU officers arrive at Cole Hall; \\no3:09 pm - Chief Grady and others enter Cole Hall to find 4 dead,  \\nincluding shooter on stage; \\no3:20 pm - Blast email sent to NIU students and posted on the NIU  \\nwebsite; \\no4:00 pm - All clear message given to campus. \\nEMT response for the injured began, essentially, when the officers arrived on the scene after \\nsecuring the auditorium where the shooting occurred. \\n Incident Command A perimeter at the scene was set up within 5 minutes. \\nIncident command was essentially up and runni\\nng within 10 minutes (time approximate) of \\nthe initiation of response. All parties to the response concur that recepti\\non and staging were set up very early in the \\nresponse and were very efficient. This in turn\\n ensured efficient staging and allocation of \\nresources (e.g. ambulances, police, fire, investig\\nators) as they arrived on scene from a variety \\nof jurisdictions and communities. \\nAll parties concur that the in\\ncident command™s structure was \\nvery clear Œ all knew that NIU \\nPolice Chief Don Grady was the incident \\ncommander. Command communication was clear \\nand effective. NIU™s Department of Public Safety emphasizes the importance of the incident commander \\n\\nbeing physically present at the actual site of \\nthe incident command for at least the first \\noperational period. The presence of the comm\\nander ensured effective decision making, \\ninformation sharing, and communications and avoided the commander™s duties being \\n\\ncomplicated, initially, by having to prepare for press statements and questions. \\nNIU™s response plan clearly established the \\nPresident as the ulti\\nmate authority on the \\nincident. The President was in communication with response leaders very soon after the \\n\\nincident and continued to receive accurate info\\nrmation to guide high level policy decisions \\nand media communications. \\nNIU™s emergency plan calls for senior campus o\\nfficials to convene at two separate venues to \\nensure continuity of leadership. \\n \\nCommunications \\n\\n \\nEmergency Communications \\nAt 3:20 pm (this time approximate and not base\\nd on official findings), only 14 minutes after \\n\\nthe first call came to the NIU dispatch center, a blast email was sent to NIU students and \\n\\nposted on the NIU website. That email aler\\nted the campus student population to the \\nemergency and provided direction for students. That email follows below: \\noﬁCAMPUS ALERT Œ 3:20 pm - There has been a report of a possible gunman on \\n\\ncampus. Get to a safe area and take precaut\\nions until given the all clear.

They are registered in a \\ncampus wide alert system. \\nNIU™s emergency response plan emphasizes a need for interoperable communications for all \\ncommand staff. The State of Illinois™ Starcom21 700/800 mhz interoperable radio \\n\\ncommunications network was utilized by NIU, an\\nd others, during the response on February \\n14, 2008 for coordinating multi-jurisdictional and interdisciplinary response. StarCom was \\n\\nnot used during the immediate response, but NIU \\nofficials have said the system was used as \\nmutual aid began to arrive. The State of Illinois also deployed one of its Illinois \\n\\nTransportable Emergency Communications Sy\\nstems (ITECS), which provided on-scene \\ninteroperability, and also a mobile command post. \\n \\nMedia Communications and Information Sharing \\nPlanning for Communications \\noNIU™s response plan on February 14, 2008 empowered communications \\n\\nadministrators and personnel to craft e\\nffective, appropriate messages on a timely \\n\\nbasis and distribute them to the public. \\noNIU™s response plan dictates that emergen\\ncy media relations be coordinated out of \\nthe Office of Public Affairs, taking the burden off of the campus police and putting \\n\\nit on those with the most expertise in media relations and communications. \\nCommunications Resources oCommunications/media relations staff knew ahead of time that land lines and some \\n\\nother forms of communication would be overwhelmed. Thus they had their own \\n\\nmultimodal systems ready to go (radios, text messaging, email, etc). \\noPublic affairs staff had trained ahead of ti\\nme and knew it would be critical to get a \\nclear and accurate message out to the campus, the press, and parents. \\noPublic affairs had a dedicated information center established with computers and \\n\\nphone lines to craft messages, respond to \\nemails, and to answer phone calls (e.g., 7 \\ndedicated phone lines). \\nNotifications and Messaging oParental notification was a priority, bu\\nt was not actually conducted until the \\nimmediate incident response was concluded to ensure the most accurate and useful \\n\\nparental notification. \\noInformation hotlines were established quickly and up and running for 48 hours. They \\n\\nwere monitored for trends in questions an\\nd concerns, and thus updated over time. \\n\\nStudent Affairs personnel routinely briefe\\nd Public Affairs personnel on the most \\nappropriate and accurate information for students and parents. \\nGeneral Awareness \\noResponse reference guides are provided in all campus classrooms and facilities. A \\n\\nclear effort is made at NIU to ensure campus-wide awareness of what emergency \\n\\nresponse will entail and appropriate response actions for students, staff and faculty. \\noUpon entry to campus, all students™ ema\\nil addresses and campus housing telephone \\nnumbers are entered into an emergency messaging system to provide automatic \\n\\nemergency messages via email and voice mail when required. \\n \\nRecovery Recovery efforts at NIU, while underway, are onl\\ny in their initial stages.

A former NIU graduate \\nstudent walked onto the stage of a large lecture hall and began ˜ring on startled students and faculty. \\n\\nThe shooter, a 28-year old male, had a history of mental illness. He shot and killed 5 students and \\nwounded 18, some critically. His suicide at the end of the brief attack brought the number of deaths \\nto 6. \\nThe building where the shooting occurred, Cole Hall, is centrally located in the interior of the \\ncampus and is directly across from a concentration of dormitories identi˜ed as Neptune East, West, \\nCentral, and North. Cole Hall contains two large lecture halls for large group classes. \\nAll of the injured who were transported were taken to Kishwaukee Community Hospital, the only \\nhospital nearby. Several of the most seriously injured were then transferred to ˜ve other hospitals \\nin the regionŠfour via helicopter and one via ground ambulance. A close examination of how the \\nemergency medical and hospital services were carried out reveals that the right decisions and actions \\n\\nwere taken during triage and treatment, lives were saved, and no one was hurt in the process of \\nproviding emergency medical services (EMS) to the victims, transporting them, or safeguarding the \\nrest of the campus immediately after the murders. \\nThe City of DeKalb Fire Department, the NIU Department of Public Safety, the hospital, and other \\nmutual-aid responders were prepared. They had practiced emergency drills together and coordi\\n-nated their planning. They were familiar with the Incident Command System (ICS) and had formally \\n\\nincorporated its use in their plans. The ˜re/EMS, university police, and university events manage\\n-ment partners had worked together frequently in planned and unplanned events, so Command and \\ncontrol procedures were well practiced. They also had studied the of˜cial report\\n1 on the Virginia Tech \\nshootings and had integrated the lessons learned enumerated in that report into the university™s and \\n\\nthe City of DeKalb™s emergency response plans, especially from the chapters that reported on the law \\nenforcement and EMS response to that April 16, 2007 incident. The value of that report, their train\\n-ing, and their joint planning was apparent in the excellent response to Cole Hall. \\nThe DeKalb Fire Department has stated they hope that what they discovered from their internal \\ndebrie˜ngs and reports can add to the lessons that were documented from Virginia Tech so that the \\nbody of experience can expand to include this most recent tragedy and help other universities, law \\n\\nenforcement agencies, and ˜re departments as the Virginia Tech report helped them. The U.S. Fire \\nAdministration (USFA) is pleased to enable the sharing of information from the NIU shooting with \\nemergency response organizations nationwide.\\n 1 Mass Shootings at Virginia TechŒReport of the Review Panel, August 2007, Richmond, Virginia.\\n B-10\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\n1CHAPTER 1: FIRE, RESCUE, SECURITY, \\nAND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS \\nAT NORTHERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY\\nNorthern Illinois University (NIU) is situated 65 miles due west of Chicago. The university™s \\n755-acre main campus is in the city of DeKalb, which has a population of 43,714, not includ\\n-ing the oncampus housing population of 5,900. NIU consists of seven colleges offering \\nundergraduate, graduate, and doctoral degrees. Total enrollment is approximately 25,000 students, \\n\\nover 90 percent of whom are located at the main campus. The remainder of the student body attends \\nclasses at NIU™s satellite centers in nearby communities. Nearly all of the students are from Illinois, \\nthough approximately eight percent are from other States and countries.\\nFIRE AND RESCUEFire and rescue services at NIU are provided by the City of DeKalb Fire Department; the campus is \\n\\npart of their response area. All regular ˜re department services are available to NIU. The DeKalb Fire \\nDepartment employs 58 career ˜re˜ghters and 2 civilian employees. There are 3 ˜re stations from \\nwhich the department provides service to approximately 50,000 people in a 70-square-mile service \\n\\narea that includes the City of DeKalb, Northern Illinois University, and the DeKalb Fire Protection \\nDistrict (an unincorporated area outside the city). Additionally, the ˜re department provides para\\n-medic-level ambulance service to the Cortland Fire Protection District under a special service contract. \\nThe DeKalb Fire Department provides a full range of emergency services: ˜re suppression, rescue, \\nemergency medical services (EMS), hazardous materials ˜rst response, ˜re prevention, and public \\neducation. There are two divisions: administration and operations. Under the ˜rst division, there is \\nthe Fire Chief, one Assistant Chief, one Training Battalion Chief, one Lieutenant, one administrative \\n\\nassistant, and one of˜ce associate. Personnel in this division work a 37-1/2-hour workweek. The \\nOperations Division functions with a 3-platoon system scheduled as 24 hours on duty and 48 hours \\noff duty. Each shift has 18 ˜re personnel, a Battalion Chief who serves as shift commander, one \\n\\nCaptain, and three Lieutenants operating as Company Of˜cers (COs), each responsible for one of the \\n\\n˜re stations. During periods of normal call volume, the department™s response time from receipt of \\nan emergency request to the arrival of emergency apparatus on scene is 3 to 5 minutes.\\nThe DeKalb Fire Department enjoys an excellent working relationship with the NIU Department of \\nPublic Safety. The two departments participate in joint training and other mutual preparedness activi\\n-ties. Other emergency service organizations, such as the City of DeKalb Police Department, Illinois \\n\\nState Police, local hospitals, DeKalb County Emergency Management, and the DeKalb County Sheriff, \\n\\nare involved in joint exercises and emergency response planning sessions.\\nIn recent years, the emergency services departments serving NIU developed and now routinely use \\nIncident Action Plans (IAPs) to structure their organizational response to scheduled events and to \\ndocument the evolution of response activities and assignments during an incident. The IAPs fol\\n-low the National Incident Management System (NIMS), which they have adopted as the model for \\nresponding to incidents and supporting those efforts.\\n APPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nB-11\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\n2  U.S. Fire Administration/Technical Report Series\\nThe DeKalb Fire Department continues to develop a close-working relationship with campus of˜cials \\nand departments at NIU. When the Governor of Virginia released the ˜nal report of his Virginia Tech \\nReview Panel, the ˜re department downloaded a copy of the report, and carefully studied the chap\\n-ters related to the services they provide to NIU. In particular, they evaluated the chapter on the EMS \\nresponse to ensure that they would be prepared if a similar event were to occur at NIU. Four-and-\\na-half months after the Virginia Tech report was published, the ˜re department had to apply what it \\nhad learned from that tragedy.\\nAUTOMATIC AID AND MUTUAL AID\\nThe ˜re department has an automatic-aid agreement with the Sycamore Fire Department to better \\n\\nserve the residents of the area between DeKalb and Sycamore, a community located a few miles \\ndirectly northeast of the City of DeKalb along Route 23. An automatic-aid request from the Sycamore \\nFire Department brings a City of DeKalb truck company response, while Sycamore sends an engine \\n\\ncompany to the DeKalb Fire Department™s automatic-aid requests. Both communities send a single \\n\\nambulance to any motor vehicle accident at certain, designated intersections. \\nMutual aid also is available through a Mutual Aid Box Alarm System (MABAS). MABAS is a State and \\ninterstate mutual-aid system, which has been in existence since the late 1960s. Pre-September 11, \\nMABAS was heavily rooted throughout northern Illinois. Since September 11, MABAS has rapidly \\n\\ngrown throughout the State of Illinois and Wisconsin, and parts of Indiana, Iowa, and Missouri. Day-\\nto-day MABAS extra alarms are systematically designed to provide speedy response of emergency \\nresources to the stricken community during an emergency. Declarations of disasters are not required \\n\\nfor routine MABAS system activations. Today, MABAS includes approximately 1,100 of the State™s \\n1,200 ˜re departments organized within 62 divisions. MABAS divisions geographically span an area \\nfrom Lake Michigan to Iowa™s border and south almost into Kentucky. Eight Wisconsin divisions also \\n\\nshare MABAS with their Illinois counterparts. The cities of Chicago, St. Louis, and Milwaukee are \\nMABAS member agencies. \\nMABAS includes over 37,000 of Illinois™ 40,000 ˜re˜ghters who staff emergency response units \\nincluding more than 1,300 ˜re stations, 1,800 engine companies, 389 ladder trucks, 831 ambu\\n-lances (mostly paramedic capable), 278 heavy rescue squads, and 647 water tankers. Fire/EMS \\nreserve (back-up) units account for more than 1,000 additional emergency vehicles. The system also \\noffers specialized operations teams for hazardous materials, underwater rescue/recovery, technical \\n\\nrescue, and incident management teams. Certi˜ed ˜re investigators can be ﬁpackagedﬂ as teams for \\nlarger incidents requiring complicated and time-consuming investigations.\\nMABAS is a unique organization in that every MABAS participant agency has signed the same con\\n-tract with their 1,100 plus counterpart MABAS agencies. Participating agencies agree to standards \\nof operation, Incident Command, minimal equipment staf˜ng, safety, and onscene terminology. \\nAll MABAS agencies operate on a common radio frequency (IFERN) and are activated for response \\nthrough predesigned ﬁrunﬂ cards that each participating agency designs and tailors to meet their \\n\\nlocal risk need. MABAS also provides mutual aid station coverage to a stricken community when \\ntheir ˜re/EMS resources are committed to an incident for an extended period. The DeKalb Fire \\nDepartment belongs to Division 6 of the area™s MABAS, and includes 13 participating and 4 associate \\n\\n˜re departments as follows:\\n B-12\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nUSFA-TR-167/August 2009\\n  \\n3Participating (Primary) Departments\\nDeKalb Fire Department - full career\\n\\nSycamore Fire Department - combination\\n\\nCortland Fire Protection District - volunteer\\n\\nGenoa-Kingston Fire Protection District - volunteer\\n\\nHinckley Fire Protection District - volunteer\\nLee Fire Protection District - volunteer\\nMalta Fire Protection District - volunteer\\n\\nShabbona Fire Protection District - volunteer\\n\\nGenoa-Kingston Rescue Squad - volunteer\\n\\nKirkland Fire Protection District - volunteer\\n\\nLeland Fire Protection District - volunteer\\n\\nSomonauk Fire Protection District - volunteer\\n\\nWaterman Fire Protection District Œ volunteer\\nAssociate (Primary in Other MABAS Divisions) Departments\\nMaple Park Fire Protection District - volunteer\\nMonroe Center Fire Protection District - volunteer\\nRochelle Fire Department - combination\\n\\nSandwich Fire Protection District - volunteer\\nCAMPUS SECURITY AND CRIME STATISTICS\\nThe university has a strong commitment to public safety. Law enforcement and security services \\nare vested with the Department of Public Safety, which is led by the police chief. The department \\nemphasizes community policing and works to build relationships with the students, faculty, and staff \\nso that problems are identi˜ed early and resolved. The department views their mission as one that \\n\\nhelps the campus community learn to keep themselves safe, thus reducing opportunities for crime. \\n\\nThe university community is encouraged to cooperate with the police in creating a safe environment \\nand reporting crimes, hazards, or suspicious activities. \\nThe NIU police force includes 60 sworn of˜cers. They have the authority to investigate crimes, make \\narrests, and help with emergencies. Of˜cers patrol the campus on a 24-hour basis, and the residence \\n\\nhalls are established as Community Safety Centers with access control. NIU police are rather unique; \\n\\nall of˜cers are now or are becoming certi˜ed as Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs). That train\\n-ing signi˜cantly enhances the services that of˜cers can provide during emergencies and was an \\n\\nimportant factor during the immediate response to the assault at Cole Hall. More details about the \\n\\npolice response are covered in Chapter 3. \\n APPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nB-13\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\n4  \\nU.S. Fire Administration/Technical Report Series\\nIn accordance with the ﬁClery Actﬂ\\n2, a Federal law, which requires institutions of higher learn\\n-ing to document their crime incident data, NIU™s Legal Services section, in cooperation with the \\nDepartment of Police and Public Safety, prepares an annual security report that shows crime statistics \\nfor each NIU campus (Main Campus, Hoffman Estates, Naperville, Rockford, Lorado Taft Field). \\n\\nThe most recent of these reports includes data from the year 2007. For the main campus, liquor \\nviolations were the prevalent offense, typical for a community with a high concentration of young \\npeople. These offenses were largely handled with disciplinary referrals, though some of the more \\n\\nserious cases brought arrests. Burglaries were the next most frequent type of incident, followed by \\n(forcible) sex offenses.\\nThe NIU police have instituted many programs to address the leading types of crime at NIU. For \\nexample, they provide comprehensive crime prevention education information on the university™s \\nsecurity policies, how to obtain immediate assistance and report a crime (including con˜dential \\nreporting procedures); how warnings would be authorized and distributed, access control of build\\n-\\nings and grounds; and a special section on safety in the residence halls; and so forth. Each dormitory \\nhas a Community Safety Center to which an NIU police of˜cer is assigned. \\nThe university™s Division of Student Affairs oversees an NIU Interpersonal Violence Response Team \\n(IVRT). Eight NIU of˜ces, including the Department of Police and Public Safety, make up the team. \\nVictims of sexual assaults, domestic violence, and stalking can con˜dentially report their situation to \\n\\nany of the IVRT member departments for action.\\nEMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS\\nNIU is part of an incident management team known as the Communiversity Incident Management \\n\\nTeam: a coalition of campus and local agencies with a stated mission of ﬁSeeking Solutions and \\n\\nSolving Problems through Collaboration.ﬂ The Communiversity Incident Management Team has both \\ncooperating and participating members. The cooperating members include the NIU Department of \\nPublic Safety, the City of DeKalb Fire Department, and the NIU Convocation Center.

They \\norganized and conducted special drills to test procedures and made adjustments to their plans that \\nre˜ected the results of their ˚eld exercises.\\nNIU™s multicasualty incident (MCI) plan had been reevaluated in the wake of the April 2007 shoot\\n-ings at Virginia Tech. The day after that tragedy, the NIU President communicated to the university \\ncommunity his intentions to examine the university™s emergency plans and preparedness in light \\nof the lessons learned from the Virginia Tech murders. The university convened a meeting of their \\nemergency management team and conducted a ﬁverbal simulationﬂ\\n3 of the Virginia Tech shootings. \\nThe NIU President™s letter also signaled the university™s intention to hold a series of drills to test and \\n\\nre˚ne their disaster communication and response plans.\\nCampus and local emergency response agencies practiced the university™s MCI plan on October \\n10, 2007. The NIU Department of Public Safety and the DeKalb Fire Department led a mock mass \\n\\ncasualty exercise to practice staging and managing resources. The regional MABAS radio system was \\ntested to ascertain whether a predetermined number of ambulances would in fact be available and \\naccessible during a mass casualty operation. The drill included mutual-aid ambulances, the County \\n\\nHealth Department, Kishwaukee Hospital, and air transport (helicopter) support.\\nPortions of those plans were tested during an actual situation, which occurred on December 8, 2007. \\nOn that day, a message was discovered in a dormitory bathroom which threatened that ﬁthings will \\nchange most hastilyﬂ as the semester drew to a close. The message reportedly included a racial slur, \\n\\nunderlined letters that spelled out WATCH, and included a question: ﬁWhat time? The VA Tech shoot\\n-ers messed up with having only one shooter–ﬂ\\n4  Of˚cials closed the campus and postponed ˚nal exams after learning of the message. NIU™s Of˚ce \\n\\nof Public Affairs used multiple channels of communication to notify everyone on campus about the \\nthreat and that the campus was being closed. According to an NIU spokesperson, that system worked \\nwell and no major changes to their alert and noti˚cation procedures were found to be necessary. NIU \\n\\nfollowed most of the same procedures on February 14, 2008, as they had 2 months earlier during \\nthe threat. \\nSTATE OF ILLINOIS\\nThe State of Illinois established a Campus Security Task Force (CSTF) 2 weeks after the Virginia Tech \\nshootings. The group included leaders in education, law enforcement, mental health, and public \\nsafety. Their mission was to identify training needs and provide programs to help security of˚cials \\nat the State™s many campuses. CSTF studied campus security issues and is charged with developing \\n\\nprocedures to improve safety. For example, Illinois created a Campus Security Enhancement Grant \\nProgram, which the Task Force recommended. The grants can be used for response training, vio\\n-lence prevention, and emergency communications equipment and messaging systems, exercises and \\n\\nplans, and awareness programs. In conjunction with the Illinois Emergency Management Agency \\n(IEMA), CSTF developed ﬁAll-Hazard Emergency Planning for Colleges and UniversitiesﬂŠa two-\\n\\nphase training initiative.\\n3 ﬁNIU had tested response plan,ﬂ Daily Chronicle, February 15, 2008.\\n4 Ibid APPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nB-15\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\n6  U.S. Fire Administration/Technical Report Series\\nPhase I provides a 5-day training course for senior college and university administrators, urges them \\nto revise their Emergency Operations Plans (EOPs) in keeping with documented ﬁbest practices,ﬂ \\nidenti˜es hazards common to campuses, and offers information about planning teams and EOP \\ndevelopment and testing.

NIU was an active member of this State \\ntask force, and a recipient of radios and the training prior to the shooting at Cole Hall, and those \\nassets contributed to the response on February 14.\\nFinally, on April 18, 2008, 2 months after the slayings at NIU, the Task Force published its report, \\nState \\nof Illinois Campus Security Task Force Report\\n, to the Governor. The report contains scores of recommenda\\n-tions and speci˜c guidance on such topics as threat assessment, use of and compliance with NIMS, \\nvolunteer management, training, emergency drills, and others. There also is a ˜ve-page chapter enti\\n-tled, ﬁObservations and Lessons Learned, February 14, 2008, Shooting Incident at Northern Illinois \\nUniversity.ﬂ The chapter describes the background on NIU emergency training, simulations, and \\ncapabilities, and then presents some information about the NIU police response, emergency com\\n-munications, public information, and recovery. Several of the ˜ndings under Incident Command, \\nhowever, are not completely in line with NIMS standards, for example, stating that the best plan is \\nfor the Chief of Department to remain at the scene. The nationally applied rudiments of NIMS call \\n\\nfor the chiefs of the ˜rst responder departments to locate where all the key stakeholder departments \\ncan coordinate information, resource requests, Command, and control where all can have their deci\\n-sions informed through a common operational picture. In fact, the Task Force Report promotes this \\nstrategy and NIMS. Thus, a police chief or ˜re chief should be available at the Emergency Operations \\nCenter (EOC) or other joint Command Post, and assign an assistant or deputy chief to manage opera\\n-tions at the actual site.\\n B-16\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\n7CHAPTER 2: BRIEF HISTORY OF THE NORTHERN ILLINOIS \\nUNIVERSITY SHOOTER AND PARALLELS TO \\nTHE VIRGINIA TECH SHOOTER\\nTo some of˜cials and faculty at NIU, the young man responsible for the deadly attack at Cole \\nHall had been the quintessential student. Described as brilliant, well-liked, respectful, and hard-\\nworking by various faculty members and other students, he seemed an unlikely person to com\\n-mit cold-blooded murder. There were no records of problems with law enforcement or incidents \\ninvolving threatening behavior on campus during his years as a student at NIU. Only upon deeper \\ninvestigation did the darker side of Stephen Kazmierczak begin to surface. \\nAs was explained in the Final Report on the Virginia Tech shootings, shooters almost always leave \\na trail of evidence that they are preparing to commit murder or murder and suicide. Typically, they \\nplan the event in their mind, take action to acquire the necessary weapons or other tools, practice, \\nand then carry out the crime. Seung Hui Cho, the person responsible for the 32 deaths at Virginia \\nTech in Blacksburg, Virginia, exhibited many ﬁred ˚agsﬂ from the time he was 14 years old. The NIU \\nassailant™s background also re˚ected patterns and a combination of signs that spoke of future trouble. \\nThere were clear indications of a deeply disturbed young man whose volatile behavior on occasion \\ncaused his family and a few friends to worry about his potential for violence. \\nThe majority of information in this chapter was gathered from an article written by David Vann for \\nEsquire magazine, entitled, ﬁPortrait of the School Shooter as a Young Man,ﬂ August 2008. It is recog\\n-nized that this source is not the usual type of source upon which USFA reports rely; however, Vann™s \\narticle cites acknowledged police sources, and newspaper and magazine stories can often contribute \\nto the body of knowledge about an event.\\nThe man who ended his own life after killing ˜ve innocent victims was raised in Elk Grove Village, \\nIllinois, and graduated from the local high school in 1998. He was an above-average student. He had \\nfew friends. Some of those he did connect with joined him in destructive activities: lighting chemi\\n-cals on ˜re, making Drano bombs, blowing things up, and shooting pellet guns at passing motorists. \\n\\nHe was questioned by police when he was in middle school after his mother, having discovered two-\\nliter bottles and the ingredients for Drano bombs in her son™s backpack, reported him to authorities. \\n\\nBy 11th grade, he was showing friends a business card from the KKK and spray painting swastikas \\non concrete sewer pipes.\\nThe murderer also suffered from mental illness. Diagnosed as bipolar, he was anxious, depressed, \\nand suffered from insomnia. He would take medication for a while, and then stop taking it because \\nthe side effects, including enormous weight gain, were so terrible. Before he graduated from high \\nschool, he had been hospitalized six times for suicide attempts or threats. He was teased at school for \\n\\nbeing ﬁcrazyﬂ and suicidal. He told a girlfriend that he wanted to hurt some people. \\n APPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nB-17\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\n8  \\nU.S. Fire Administration/Technical Report Series\\nMany times his parents sought medical help for their son. They also asked the high school to conduct \\nan evaluation of him. Instead, the school gave them a book on how to deal with disabled students. \\nIn contrast, the Virginia Tech shooter™s high school did conduct an evaluation and developed an indi\\n-vidualized evaluation plan (IEP) that accommodated his emotional disability. That assailant™s parents \\nalso obtained counseling support and medical attention for their son from 8th grade through 11th \\n\\ngrade.\\nIn the fall of his senior year of high school, Kazmierczak somehow made it to school after having \\nswallowed an entire bottle of pills. A teacher took him to the nurse™s of˜ce, where he told the nurse \\n\\nthat he wanted to die. Several days later he and a friend were stopped by police for smoking mari\\n-juana. His father tried to keep drug dealers away from his son by reporting them to the police. When \\n\\nhe graduated, the young man did not go on to college or a job; instead, he moved into a group home \\n\\nfor psychiatric patients. Over the next 3 years, he landed in another residential treatment program, \\nobtained and lost several jobs at drug stores and a discount department store, and became inspired \\nto pursue college, enrolling in a few classes at a local community college. Then he stopped taking all \\n\\nmedications and enlisted in the Army in September 2001. \\nFor a short time, Army life worked well. The structure helped him function and he was recog\\n-nized for his ability to shoot without emotional or psychological response. He was proud. Then, in \\nFebruary 2002, he was returned to his hometown, discharged from the Army after they discovered \\nhe concealed his mental health history, hallucinations, and suicide attempts. The discharge hit him \\n\\nhard. He enrolled at NIU and by late August 2002, was sharing a dormitory suite with three other \\nstudents. One of his classes was at Cole Hall, the place where he would murder and wound many \\nstudents 6 years later. \\nAs was the case with the shooter from Virginia Tech, college roommates of NIU™s shooter considered \\nhim to be very strange. One of them later told police that their roommate rarely left the dorm room \\nexcept for classes and to get something to eat. He would not go out, preferring to play video games. \\n\\nA similar pro˜le matched the mass killer at Virginia Tech, whose emotional disability of selective \\n\\nmutism was related to his isolation. The NIU assailant spoke persistently and admiringly of Adolph \\nHitler, Jeffrey Dahmer, Ted Bundy, and other mass murderers. He examined the methods of the \\nColumbine and Virginia Tech killers. His favorite author was Nietzsche. Even with all of this in the \\n\\nbackground, the perpetrator did well academically and his social life improved. He earned an A in an \\nextremely tough statistics course, ranking third out of 90 students. \\nMay 2006 arrived and Kazmierczak graduated from NIU, winning a Dean™s Award and planned to \\npursue graduate studies there in the fall of that year. As happened throughout his life, the period \\nof progress was short-lived. His mother died, he began having problems with his girlfriend, and \\n\\nNIU cut back on advanced courses, particularly in the area of criminology, which was to be the \\n\\nfocus of his master™s degree. He would have to get his advanced degree at the University of Illinois \\nin Champaign, which was a three-hour drive from DeKalb. His favorite professor wrote a letter of \\nrecommendation for his application to the University of Illinois. Meanwhile, he stopped going to \\n\\nhis graduate classes at NIU, reasoning that the credits would not transfer to the University of Illinois \\n\\nanyway. Instead, he focused on purchasing guns and going to the shooting range. Cho did exactly \\nthe same thing during the months immediately before his April 2007 attack, the worst shooting \\nby an individual in the history of the United States. In February 2007, one year before he planned \\n\\nand carried out the multiple fatality shooting and suicide, Kazmierczak bought a Glock .45-caliber \\nhandgun. In March, he added a shotgun and another handgun to his collection. Since he had been \\noff his medications for 5 years, the gun purchases were legal.\\n B-18\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nUSFA-TR-167/August 2009\\n  \\n9After the Virginia Tech incident occurred, the NIU shooter became excited and studied everything \\nhe could about the Virginia Tech assailant, including where that person bought his guns.\\n5 He was \\nintrigued with the fact that Cho chained the doors shut at Norris Hall in preparation for the ensuing \\nmassacre, and he commented to his new best friend that Cho ﬁobviously planned it out well.ﬂ \\nIn June 2007, he and his on-again, off-again girlfriend moved to Champaign, Illinois. They got jobs \\nand signed up for graduate classes at the university. With all the major changes, he began to unravel. \\nHe was paranoid and anxious, and began having severe mood swings again. At the urging of his girl\\n-friend, he made an appointment with and spoke to a social worker at the University of Illinois health \\ncenter. A follow up with a psychiatrist at the hospital was made, but before he kept that appointment, \\nand mindful of how psychiatric treatment could impact his ability to purchase guns, he immediately \\n\\ntraded in two of his guns and his shotgun for a Sig Sauer .380. The doctor who treated him put him \\nback on medication. \\nKazmierczak continued to do well academically, and thus, did not draw any particular attention to his \\nmental and emotional problems. Abruptly, however, he stopped attending classes and began working \\n\\nas a correctional of˜cer in Rockville, Indiana. He liked the training, but the job itself was not what he \\nexpected, so he ended that as well. Again he stopped taking his medicine, argued angrily online with \\nfriends, and began lining up anonymous, clandestine sexual encountersŠa new addiction. (The \\nVirginia Tech murderer also met with a call girl at a hotel a few days before that massacre.)\\nRight after Christmas 2007, the NIU killer returned to the gun dealer and purchased a new gun \\nand a 12-gauge shotgun. He isolated himself from friends. Early in February 2008, he bought gear \\n\\nfrom a gun supply store along with a spring-loaded knifeŠanother imitation of the shooter he most \\nadmired. Monday morning, February 11, Kazmierczak prepared for the murders he planned. He \\nsawed off the barrel of the shotgun and collected the pistols and ammunition he had hidden. He told \\nhis girlfriend he needed to visit his godfather who was ill, and drove three hours to DeKalb, checking \\ninto a hotel. Over the next 2 days, he bought books and gifts for his girlfriend. Just like the shooter \\nat the Blacksburg, Virginia campus, NIU™s shooter went to the post of˜ce and mailed a package, only \\nhis was addressed to his girlfriend and not to a major New York City news station. Finally, he took \\n\\nsteps to remove electronically-traceable information by removing the SIM card from his phone and \\nthe hard drive from his laptop computer. Cho™s computer hard drive was never located by authorities \\neither, despite a prolonged search.

One of the students, a 23-year-old geography major sitting near the back \\nof the auditorium was listening to the professor discuss ﬁdiatoms and microbiotic animals from the \\n\\ndeep seaﬂ\\n6 when a thin young man carrying a shotgun kicked open a side door at the back of the \\nstage, appeared on the stage to the right of the podium, and walked toward it. The assailant said noth\\n-ing before ˜ring, ˜rst at the professor and then at students sitting in the front row of the large room. \\nStunned, a few students at ˜rst thought it was a prank. Most, however, immediately realized the \\ndeadly assault for what it was and rushed to the aisles to get out of the auditorium. Students were \\npushing through the rows of desks and seats to get to the aisles while others who had already \\nreached the aisles, raced toward the back of the auditorium. The students were frantic to get out, \\nrunning around on top of others, screaming. The shooter reloaded the shotgun once (for a total of \\nsix shotgun blasts) and then used two separate handguns to continue ˜ring at students as they ˚ed \\n\\nup the aisles to the exit doors. He left the stage and walked up and down both main aisles, ˜ring at \\nstudents as they ˚ed or remained frozen in their seats. After ˜ring nearly 60 rounds, Kazmierczak \\nthen returned to the stage, turned the weapon on himself and died of a gunshot wound to the head. \\nMost of those who were wounded made it outside and from there dispersed to different loca\\n-tions, primarily the Holmes Student Center and the Neptune residence hall complex. The more seri\\n-ously wounded were too injured to leave. The horri˜c attack was over so quickly that when rapidly \\nresponding of˜cers arrived at the scene the perpetrator was already dead. \\nFIRST ACTIONS \\nStudents running out of Cole Hall passed a DeKalb onduty ˜re shift commander in his vehicle and \\n\\nshouted that there had just been a shooting. The of˜cer immediately radioed this information to the \\n\\nDeKalb 9-1-1 Center. The ˜rst recorded call to dispatch logged in at 3:07 p.m. Within a couple min\\n-utes, DeKalb Fire and Rescue set up operations at a Staging Area that had been predesignated at the \\n\\nmass casualty incident drill at NIU, and the onduty shift personnel and their vehicles began arriving. \\nNIU police of˜cers were on campus near the scene and responded in less than 1 minute after the \\ntime of the 9-1-1 call. They passed students rushing from the scene, some of whom gave a quick \\ndescription of the shooter. As police entered Cole Hall, they discovered the dead shooter on the stage, \\ndeceased and seriously injured students (including the instructor who was a graduate student), and \\n\\nabout a half dozen or more students who were sitting in their seats in shock. \\n  6 ﬁ5 Dead in NIU Shootingﬂ, Chicago Sun-Times, February 14, 2008\\n APPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nB-21\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\n12  \\nU.S. Fire Administration/Technical Report Series\\nFigure 2: Tactical Police Forces Rush to the Scene\\n The police of˜cers faced two immediate tasks: rule out the possibility of other shooters so that the ˜re \\ndepartment™s emergency medical responders could be cleared to come on site, and assist in triaging the \\nwounded. The of˜cers approached the seated students and asked them to show their hands and stand \\n\\nup, while simultaneously checking whether any of them had been shot. A couple of the students identi\\n-˜ed the shooter, indicating toward the stage and saying, ﬁHe™s the shooter. He did this.ﬂ Asked if there \\n\\nwas anybody else, they responded ﬁNo, no, this guy right here.ﬂ Of˜cers removed students who were \\nnot physically wounded from the room and then went to each victim, checking pulses and breathing. \\nUsing their emergency medical training, the NIU police of˜cers attended to the wounded, assessing \\ntheir injuries and providing immediate aid. Other of˜cers were busy establishing ˜rst, second, and \\nthird perimeters around the scene and responding to the various victim collection points where injured \\n\\nstudents had dispersed after escaping Cole Hall. \\nInitial interface between police and ˜re/EMS senior commanders occurred at Cole Hall. NIU™s \\nDepartment of Public Safety was the lead agency until the shooter was identi˜ed and determined to be \\nthe only assailant. Then Command shifted to the DeKalb Fire and Rescue Department until all victims \\nhad been transported, about 3 hours after the incident began. At that time, the focus shifted to investi\\n-gation and Incident Command returned to NIU™s Department of Public Safety. \\nAt 3:07 p.m., the DeKalb Fire Department requested that two medic units and an engine (a box 10 \\ngeneral alarm) report to the Field House Lot 21Ša predesignated Staging Area on campus. The Fire \\nChief arrived at 3:08 p.m. and established the ˜re/EMS Command as engines and ambulances began \\narriving at a Staging Area. Two minutes later, all offduty ˜re department personnel were called to duty. \\nCalls to 9-1-1 were coming in from multiple locations, raising concerns that there might be more than \\none shooter. The DeKalb Assistant Fire Chief conferred immediately with an NIU police lieutenant ask\\n-ing, ﬁDo we know that there™s only a single shooter?ﬂ The lieutenant radioed others in his department \\nand in about 2 minutes con˜rmed, ﬁIt was just one shooter, and the shooter is dead.ﬂ\\n7 7  Taken from Report of Proceedings of Debrie˜ng of DeKalb Fire Department Responding to Northern Illinois University \\non February 14, 2008, taken at DeKalb Fire Station No. 1, on March 7, 2008.\\n B-22\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nUSFA-TR-167/August 2009\\n  13Records indicate the time was about 3:15 p.m. when Cole Hall was declared secure. The ˜re depart\\n-ment™s Medical Units could then respond to the crime scene from their Staging Area. Fire and EMS \\nCommand established a ˜re of˜cer at each dispersal site. Information on the number of victims and \\ntheir conditions per triage color was communicated via radio to Command. Command assigned \\n\\ncompanies from Staging to the dispersal sites. Fire, university police, and convergent responders \\nprovided medical assistance to the injured students. There were some medical equipment shortages \\nearly in the response. (Since the event, NIU pursued a grant to acquire EMS equipment that would \\n\\nbe interoperable with the DeKalb Fire and Rescue Department equipment and which would be \\nprepositioned at sites on campus.)\\nBetween 3:15 and 3:20 p.m., the alarm was upgraded to a second and then a third alarm. At 3:25 \\np.m., the ˜re/EMS Command requested two helicopters to respond to the Kishwaukee Community \\nHospital and at 3:26 p.m.Šonly 11 minutes after ˜re/EMS providers were allowed access to the \\n\\nwoundedŠthe ˜rst patients from the scene began transport to the hospital. Helicopters were \\nrequested, not to transport from the scene to the hospital, but to be available to transport any criti\\n-cally injured victims from the Kishwaukee Community Hospital to a higher level trauma center.\\nAt 3:28 p.m., the alarm again was upgraded, this time to the ˜fth level, which also included all the \\nresources of the fourth level. By 4:54 p.m., less than 90 minutes after the ˜rst victim was transported, \\nthe 18th (and last) patient transported arrived at the hospital.\\nTRIAGE AND TREATMENT\\nBy all measures, the ˜re˜ghters and police of˜cers who cared for, triaged, and managed the treat\\n-ment of the wounded did an outstanding job. There were several factors that had to be considered \\nby the responders. They knew that not all the injured were at Cole Hall; those who were ambulatory \\n\\nhad ˚ed to other locations on campus. However, the medics did not know how many there were nor \\n\\nthe severity of their injuries. What was clear was that the victims who remained in Cole Hall were \\n\\neither already dead or seriously wounded. The medics knew that during the ˜rst critical minutes, \\n\\ntheir resources (personnel, ambulances, etc.) were limited until the additional resources that had \\n\\nbeen called could get to the Staging Area and receive their assignments. There were three paramedics \\n\\nto deal with nine victims at Cole Hall, all of whom were triaged within 11 minutes. Decisions had \\n\\nto be made about whether to use Herculean efforts and all their resources to try to revive victims \\n\\nwho were not breathing and had no pulse or to focus ˜rst on several victims who, despite signi˜cant \\n\\ninjuries, might be saved. Mass casualty protocols establish that the priority should be individuals \\n\\nwho have a chance of surviving. When it is clear that a victim will die of their injuries despite mas\\n-sive intervention, and there are other seriously injured victims needing treatment as well, the right \\n\\npriority is to care for those who might live. \\nThe victims were located at seats near the front of the auditorium and in the aisles. Figure 3 shows \\nthe locations of the injured and dead victims at Cole Hall. One of the ˜rst actions taken was to get \\n\\nthe nonwounded students who were in shock to leave Cole Hall so paramedics could access and treat \\n\\nseriously injured victims more easily. Likewise, some of the injured had to be moved so they could \\n\\nbe treated and so that other victims could be accessed. The room contained many rows of chairs and \\n\\ndesks con˜gured in three sections between which were two aisles. The desks were folded out so it \\n\\nwas dif˜cult to move through the rows, especially when victims were on the ˚oor between seats. \\n\\nA decision was made to move a few victims from the seats into the aisles so their wounds could be \\n\\nmore effectively treated. After each victim was checked, they were assigned a priority number for \\ntransport. \\n APPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nB-23\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\n14  U.S. Fire Administration/Technical Report Series\\nStaff on the ˜rst ambulances that arrived thought ahead and brought every backboard they could \\n˜nd and dropped them at Cole Hall while the ˜rst patient was being transferred into the ambulance. \\nMedics then could get a headstart on readying the other injured victims for transport so that when \\nsubsequent ambulances arrived, patients were very quickly moved from Cole Hall into the vehicles. \\nFigure 3: Status of Victims at Cole Hall by Order of Transport\\nThe medics conducted an effective triage and in so doing, saved lives. The Fire Chief called Kishwaukee \\n\\nHospital and alerted the Emergency Department that he had a multiple-victim shooting at NIU and \\nthat the ˜rst six patients the hospital would receive were triaged as red. Updates were provided as \\nthe situation developed. The hospital reported later that because they had early noti˜cation from the \\n\\nprehospital providers about the number and condition of the victims, they were well prepared to \\nhandle the surge in the emergency room. \\nThe ˜rst victim was transported at 3:26 p.m. for the short trip to the hospital. That victim had suf\\n-fered a gunshot wound to the abdomen and chest. Because she was a priority during triage and due \\nto the early alert, Kishwaukee Hospital™s surgeons were ready and waiting to take her into surgery \\nthe minute the ambulance arrived. She survived. The second patient that was transported had a direct \\nshotgun blast to the chest. She was one of only two conscious patients found in the auditorium. The \\n\\nnext patients were taken by ambulance; both suffered direct gunshots to the head, were unconscious, \\nand had labored breathing. The ˜fth and ˜nal patient to depart Cole Hall was the other conscious \\nvictim; he had a shoulder injury from the shooting. \\nThe remaining four victimsŠthe shooter and three of his victimsŠwere considered nonviable.

They saw the carnage, and knew they did not have a Triage Of˜cer to run the transporta\\n-tion phase and start the triage program. So the three paramedics who were there declared everyone \\n\\nwho was still alive as critical, and they proceeded accordingly. Fortunately, all injured victims were \\n\\ngoing to be taken to the same hospital, making their tracking somewhat easier. \\nTwo ambulances brought equipment to Cole Hall. As noted, Medic 2 and Medic 3 brought extra \\nbackboards and supplies, which made a big difference in the ability of the paramedics to manage the \\ncasualties. Essentially, they packaged the patients and had them ready so that when the ambulances \\narrived, the paramedics could quickly slide the backboard onto a stretcher and then out to the wait\\n-ing ambulance and on to the hospital. The ambulance crews were inside Cole Hall for only a few \\nminutes.\\nThe remainder of the shooting victims dispersed to ˜ve locations away from Cole Hall. Three patients \\nwent to the Holmes Student Center, six students ran to three different dormitories (Neptune East and \\nCentral, and DuSable), and three more students headed directly to the Health Services building.

They carefully reviewed procedures with NIU police and others. \\nAfter a note was discovered threatening to improve upon the attack strategy from Virginia Tech, ˜rst \\nresponder of˜cials asked themselves what they would do if the threat were to become reality. The \\n\\ngroup identi˜ed speci˜c areas on campus where responding units would be staged, one for Fire and \\nEMS resources, another for law enforcement, and so forth. \\nThus, on February 14, ˜re commanders knew that rather than respond immediately to the various \\nlocations where wounded victims had assembled, they needed to report to Fire and EMS Staging at \\n\\nLot 21. Part of the rationale for reporting ˜rst to a staging site during a mass casualty incident was to \\nensure that all personnel were safe, that the police knew where they were, and that each unit could \\nbe centrally directed to respond once the ﬁall clearﬂ was received from law enforcement, con˜rming \\n\\nthe scene was safe for ˜re and EMS operations. \\nAfter the incident, personnel discussed how Staging had been a secondary concern during the pro\\n-cess of developing an MCI plan because Staging had always worked out well in the past, and it did not \\nseem necessary to devote a lot of effort to planning a Staging operation. The NIU incident showed \\n\\nthat it is valuable to develop a Staging and Logistics Section of a mass casualty incident plan because \\nlogistics proved to be more challenging than was anticipated. Many factors had to be considered in \\nreceiving and positioning all the equipment that arrived on the scene.\\nDuring the incident there were many pieces of apparatus that responded. Not all of them were \\nused, but at the time of the alarms, the full scope of the incident was not known and they had to be \\nprepared to handle a range of possible contingencies. The area became congested and ˜re personnel \\nhad some dif˜culties maintaining open lanes for the ambulances. One of˜cer asked for assistance \\n\\nfrom another ˜re˜ghter and he took charge of managing the equipment when they arrived at the \\nbottleneck at University Circle. \\n APPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nB-27\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\n18  U.S. Fire Administration/Technical Report Series\\nFigure 7: Fire Department Staging Area \\n Rather quickly ˜re of˜cials recognized that Lot 21 was not large enough to handle the number of \\nresponding units, and switched the Staging Area from Lot 21 to Lot 20, which was directly across \\nfrom Lot 21. The shift was made when some pieces of equipment experienced problems turning \\naround and maneuvering in Lot 21. So Staging moved to Lot 20, the closest access point for ambu\\n-lances to Cole Hall. However, even at that location, due to the layout of the campus, responders had \\nto walk about 150 yards to get to Cole Hall. \\nFigure 8: Medics Had to Walk a Distance From the Triage Sites to the Ambulances\\n  B-28\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nUSFA-TR-167/August 2009\\n  19Once word came that the scene was of˜cially declared secure, medics and ambulances responded from \\nthe Staging Area to the six sites where victims were assembled, beginning with Cole Hall where the \\nmost seriously wounded were located.

The greater alarm ambulances (six) were held to ensure there was reserve capacity. The hos\\n-pital and the DeKalb Fire Department intend to add this consideration to their plans, ensuring that \\nthere are other available transports in case helicopter operations are ruled out for reasons of weather, \\nmaintenance, or unavailable due to other prior calls for service. \\nThe difference between the transport situation at NIU and the one at Virginia Tech was that the clos\\n-est hospital to the campus in Blacksburg, VA, was permitted to divert all other incoming emergency \\ntransporters in order to handle the most critically injured victims. Moreover, there were many more \\nvictims at Virginia Tech. Due to high winds grounding helicopter operations, all transport from the \\n\\nscene had to be by ground via ambulance or other vehicles to several different hospitals. Kishwaukee \\nHospital was not allowed to divert because it is the only hospital within 30 miles of another hospital. \\nKishwaukee is the closest hospital to the NIU campus. All victims were taken ˜rst to Kishwaukee, and \\n\\nif necessary, transferred to other hospitals.  The other hospitals are at least 30 miles or more from \\n\\nDeKalb and the university. \\nLaw enforcement units were staged at the Wirtz building near the telecommunications and public \\nsafety of˜ces of the university. Command was established in the parking lot directly east of Cole \\nHall. Throughout the late afternoon and evening, law enforcement of˜cers guarded Cole Hall as seen \\n\\nin Figure 10.

The reporter called the Assistant Vice \\n\\nPresident for Public Affairs at NIU to con˜rm there had been a shooting. She tried to reach of˜cials \\nat the NIU Department of Public Safety, but all the of˜cers had left to respond to the scene. She \\nthen called the President of the University who had just been noti˜ed. The Assistant Vice President \\n\\nfor Public Affairs immediately recommended to the President that she activate NIU™s Emergency \\nCommunications Plan and the President agreed, entrusting her to go forward with the alert to cam\\n-pus and prepare for the media™s inquiries. The rapid decision by the President, and the rapid response \\nfrom Public Affairs meant that the campus received information very quickly on what had happened \\nand what actions they were instructed to take. NIU had a plan for communicating emergency infor\\n-mation. They understood the importance of immediate noti˜cation through a direct chain of com\\n-mand, rather than waiting until the crisis management team was assembled to discuss the situation \\n\\nin a meeting. When facts are communicated quickly, panic and rumors are controlled.\\nAt 3:20 p.m.Šonly eight minutes after receiving authorization for an emergency alertŠPublic \\nAffairs pushed out the ˜rst alert on the university™s Web site and simultaneously sent broadcast emails \\n\\nand voicemails and recorded a hotline message, all of which stated: \\n ﬁThere has been a report of a possible gunman on campus. Get to a safe area and take precautions \\nuntil given the all-clear. Avoid the King Commons and all buildings in that vicinity.ﬂ\\nSome students could see the drama unfolding from their dormitory windows. A few reported seeing \\npeople running and screaming. Looking out some of the windows, resident students saw emergency \\n\\nmedical personnel treating wounded victims who had run out of Cole Hall. Intercom systems inside \\nthe dormitories alerted students to remain calm and stay in their rooms. A dorm monitor reportedly \\nwould not allow students to walk in the hallways and made sure they stayed in their rooms with \\n\\nthe doors locked. The dorm monitor demonstrated excellent leadership and responsibility and acted \\nexactly as one would hope during such emergencies.\\nWhen Public Affairs posted the ˜rst alert they used the ﬁIncludeﬂ function on the menu to simulta\\n-neously post the alert link to the NIU homepage, the Students page, the Faculty/Staff page, and the \\nNews & Events section. As the situation evolved and information was updated, they used one page \\nthat sequentially documented each update. Every entry was time-stamped, and, based on a tip they \\nhad gotten from Virginia Tech, they struck through the text that was updated, but kept it on the page \\n B-34\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nUSFA-TR-167/August 2009\\n  \\n25so readers could monitor the progress of updates. A crisis Web site replaced the homepage with \\nspecial headings: Latest Information, News and Notices, Counseling, Resources and Related Links \\n(e.g., Campus Police, Kishwaukee Community Hospital, Psychological Services Center, etc.) and the \\nhotline numbers. A video of the ˜rst press conference was later included. Links to condolences, vig\\n-ils, and community response were added on the second day.\\nThroughout that day and into the next, NIU held multiple press conferences. The ˜rst was held \\nat 5:30 p.m. on February 14. It covered the basic facts which were con˜rmed at that time and \\n\\nannounced which law enforcement agencies were involved: University Police, DeKalb, Sycamore, \\nFBI, ATF, and State Police. NIU told the media to watch the NIU Web site for updates and future news \\nconference scheduling. That press conference and all subsequent press conferences were streamed \\n\\nlive on the Web site, which was heavily accessed by parents, alumni, and others.\\nThe university™s Public Affairs Of˜ce was prepared in many ways. Providentially, the of˜ce had reached \\nout to the Public Affairs Of˜ce at Virginia Tech several months after that tragedy to ask what advice \\nthey might have on preparing for and dealing with a mass casualty incident. The Virginia Tech Public \\nInformation Of˜cer was generous with his time and shared information about the lessons they had \\n\\nlearned. The Assistant Vice President for Public Affairs was included on a committee charged by the \\n\\nNIU President with a line-by-line review of the ˜nal report produced by the staff and members of \\nthe Virginia Tech Review Panel. NIU™s Virginia Tech Review Committee used that report as a template \\nfor considering additions and changes to their own plans. \\nIn another proactive step toward preparedness, the Public Affairs Of˜ce at NIU monitored Virginia \\nTech™s website for a long time after the slayings at that campus, and they remained current with \\n\\nthe memorials, events, and details about the incident so they could be informed of the issues that \\nVirginia Tech faced which NIU wanted to capture for their own planning. \\nOne of Virginia Tech™s recommendations to NIU during their conversations about lessons learned \\nwas that NIU should secure additional servers to handle the communications surge that arises when \\n\\nany major incident occurs. NIU fortunately did buy and install six additional servers, otherwise, \\ntheir site almost certainly would have crashed (at one point they had 14 million ﬁhitsﬂ). The Public \\nAffairs Of˜ce was deluged with calls from parents seeking information about their children, foreign \\n\\nconsulates wanting to know if any of their students were affected, and the media. All the local media \\n\\nindicated they were on their way to the campus and the sound of media helicopters overhead fol\\n-lowed shortly.\\nAt 3:30 p.m., only 20 minutes after the NIU President learned of the shooting, the crisis team \\nassembled in the President™s conference room which became a de facto emergency operations center \\n(EOC). The NIU crisis team consists of: \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTechnology\\n\\n APPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nB-35\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\n26  \\nU.S. Fire Administration/Technical Report Series\\nThe police chief remained on the scene at Cole Hall, rather than reporting to the university™s EOC at \\nAltgeld Hall, so he could communicate basic facts via radio. The crisis team decided to cancel classes \\nuntil further notice, acted to make counseling available, scheduled a news conference for 5:30 p.m. \\nand established student/parent hotlines. University of˜cials had experience setting up and using a \\n\\nhotline because the previous semester they had needed to activate a hotline operation twice: during \\na ˚ood in late August on the day before fall classes were to have begun, and in December, when a \\ngraf˜ti threat was discovered in a residence hall bathroom. Also, hotlines were part of the mass casu\\n-alty drill they had practiced during homecoming. The Division of Student Affairs staffed the hotlines \\n\\nand had at their disposal the most up-to-date information about the incident and what was being \\n\\nreleased to the public. \\nAltgeld Hall, the main administration center of NIU, was established as the media center. Public Affairs \\ndirected operations of the media center, including opening two conference rooms for the media, \\nprovided wireless Internet access, and began collecting media names, e-mail addresses, and other \\n\\ncontact information, and generally seeing to the reporters™ needs. It was recognized the President \\n\\nneeded to be highly visible, and as much information as possible needed to be released as quickly \\nas possible. The media had inundated the campus with reporters, vehicles, and equipment. They had \\nan edge on the university in reporting some details because the media had dozens of reporters near \\nthe scene and all over campus. One of the lessons NIU learned was that all public emergency com\\n-munications should direct people to the website for details and updates. Linking the NIU Web site to \\nthat of Kishwaukee Hospital also proved helpful to families and friends seeking information about \\nloved ones.\\nA series of news conferences was carried out. Updates on the status of the victims and the university™s \\nactivities were explained to the media. From their counterparts at Virginia Tech, NIU Public Affairs \\nof˜cials also picked up helpful tips for the Web site, such as how to ﬁgo darkﬂ with the banners and \\nbackground so that what one sees immediately is the emergency informationŠone does not have to \\n\\nsearch through extraneous text on the homepage to locate that information. Key timeline entries for \\nthe public information that was communicated are included in the earlier timeline table.\\nFigure 13: NIU President, Dr. Peters, at the Second News Conference\\n  B-36\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nUSFA-TR-167/August 2009\\n  27Throughout the course of the afternoon and evening, NIU Public Affairs staff continued to feed new \\ninformation to key stakeholders, wrote and disseminated public updates, handled media calls, and \\ngathered, created, and distributed photos, maps, diagrams and so forth.

It is an \\naf˜liate hospital in the Illinois Trauma SystemŠnot a Level 1 Trauma Center, but nevertheless can \\nhandle, and does handle trauma patients within the Emergency Department. The hospital has 15 \\nbeds in the ED, 13 private rooms, and two trauma bays, though on the day of the incident, the other \\n\\nrooms were used to handle traumas as well. The hospital is only 5 minutes away from the Northern \\nIllinois University campus. One of the doctors, who was managing the Emergency Department at \\nKishwaukee Hospital the afternoon of February 14, participated in a comprehensive debrie˜ng on \\n\\nFebruary 28, 2008. The debrie˜ng was held at the hospital and attended by the ˜re department EMS \\nstaff who responded the day of the shooting. The details contained in this section are drawn heavily \\nfrom the transcript of that debrie˜ng and from the after action presentation the hospital representa\\n-tives gave at a conference later that year.\\nAt the time of the shooting there were seven nurses, two EMTs, a unit clerk, and two emergency \\nphysicians on duty. An additional nurse and physician were en route to the hospital to open their \\n\\nFast Track area at 4 p.m. Noti˜cation to the hospital staff about the shooting came from multiple \\nsources: the DeKalb Fire Department, family members who worked at NIU or who were police or \\n˜re personnel. \\n Once noti˜ed of the shooting, the hospital quickly formed a team of doctors, surgeons, nurses, and \\nother technical staff to handle the incoming patients. The doctor in charge assembled ˜ve doctors, \\nfour general surgeons, and six orthopedic surgeons. Other medical staff, nurses, radiologists, labora\\n-tory personnel, and so forth supported the surge requirements to treat the wounded.\\nKishwaukee Hospital activated the Illinois Regional Hospital Coordinating Center system through \\nthe region™s designated center at Rockford Memorial Hospital located about 40 miles northeast of \\nKishwaukee. The Illinois Department of Public Health has established 11 regional EMS and trauma \\nareas and designated a lead hospital in each region that is responsible for coordinating hospital \\n\\nsupport during major emergencies and for managing regional preparedness planning. That hospital \\nserves the role of disaster assistance coordinator for other hospitals in the region that are confronted \\nwith a medical emergency situation which presents a challenge to the hospital™s normal resources \\n\\nand capabilities. \\nRockford Memorial Hospital, as the lead hospital for the region in which Kishwaukee is located, \\nhelped to manage additional medical-related resources. The lead hospitals in the system are respon\\n-sible for ˜nding extra ambulances at the required levels (basic, advanced life support, etc.), for \\n\\nobtaining helicopters for air medical transfers, and for other medically-related assistance. They draw \\n\\nresources from other hospitals and transport services in the region and coordinate with the Illinois \\nEmergency Management Agency. The designated hospital establishes a command site and remotely \\nmanages support from that location. The afternoon and evening of the shooting, Rockford worked \\n\\nto obtain helicopters from the east and the south because one of the helicopters normally used was \\ndown for maintenance, and weather problems to the north affected the availability of helicopters in \\nthat area. \\n B-38\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nUSFA-TR-167/August 2009\\n  29The Illinois Department of Public Health provided immediate support. Law enforcement of˜cers \\narrived to secure the emergency room. This was a wise move to protect both hospital emergency per\\n-sonnel and the patients. In these types of situationsŠmass casualties as a result of criminal actionŠit \\n\\nis important to protect against the possibility that whatever happened at the scene could transfer into \\n\\nthe hospital environment. Medical staff needs to focus on treating the wounded without having to \\nworry about intruders or people bent on retaliation ˜nding their way into treatment areas. \\nThere were many preparations that had to be made. Hospital personnel had to consider relocating \\nsome of the nine patients who were already in the emergency department. Rooms had to be made \\n\\navailable and prepared with a trauma ˚ow sheet and other forms. They needed extra crash carts, chest \\ntube set-ups, and blood. They had only one available helicopter and called Rockford Memorial for \\nmore.\\nOnce patients began arriving, the hospital had dif˜culty with patient identi˜cation. Because the \\nscene had been secured so quickly and the victims moved out so fast, no triage tags were used. The \\nstudents™ belongings were scattered, and information that would typically identify them was in their \\nbackpacks back at Cole Hall.\\nA mass casualty incident with gunshot wound victims is a complicated and problematic scenario. \\nAs noted by the doctor during the debrie˜ng, when medical staff begins treating gunshot-wound \\n\\nvictims, the ballistics of the guns that were used is not usually known, so the extent of internal injury \\nis dif˜cult to assess at the outset. The location of the entry wound is only the starting point. It may \\nappear as though the injury is minor, but in reality the bullet may have taken a direction that affected \\n\\nmajor organs, veins, or arteries. Bullets can move anywhere. In fact there were several victims who \\nat ˜rst appeared to have sustained only minor injuries, but who in fact, were critical. Hospital staff \\nknew that the vital signs with young victims can change quite rapidly; they can be stable and main\\n-tain that condition for a long time and then suddenly drop to critical levels. \\nKishwaukee had two radiologists who came down to the emergency room immediately and con\\n-ducted real time positron emission tomography (PET) scans. As scans were taken, the radiologists \\nread the results which aided in determining who needed surgery and in what priority order. The \\n\\ninformation also helped with decisions concerning which victims needed to be transferred to other \\nhospitals (Kishwaukee Community Hospital is not a trauma center). \\nLater, the hospital said they were pleased with how well their system and response plan for a mass \\ncasualty incident worked. They noted that the disaster exercise from the previous year, when the \\n\\nmedical response system was tested for a mass casualty event, had contributed to the plan™s success \\nwhen made operational and it saved lives. That plan was the basis for their response and they ˚exed \\nit to ˜t the situation where needed. \\nThree of the injured victims were critical and had to be resuscitated. One had a tension pneumotho\\n-rax, another tension hemothorax, and a third who presented with a blood pressure of 60 who had \\nhemoperitoneum and cardiac involvement. All were saved. \\nSeventeen individuals were transported to Kishwaukee Community Hospital. From there, eight vic\\n-tims were taken to other hospitals in the region.

Since the vast majority of NIU students are from communities within a \\n100-mile radius of DeKalb, family members of the students who were killed and wounded began \\n\\narriving shortly after the incident and went directly to the hospital. The hospital™s communications \\n\\nsystem was inundated with calls, and the attending physicians in the Emergency Room were con\\n-tending with multiple communication issues. They were dealing with EMS, the police, the State, \\n\\nfamilies, in-house physicians, and trauma surgeons. Some of the wounded students wanted to hand \\n\\ntheir phones over to the doctors so the doctors could brief a parent or a sibling about the student™s \\n\\ncondition, all while orders were ˜ying back and forth and treatment was being administered. \\n*One patient underwent surgery at both hospitals and is counted at both locations.\\n APPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nB-41\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\n32  \\nU.S. Fire Administration/Technical Report Series\\nEmergency room doctors at Kishwaukee hospital allowed those among the most critically wounded \\nwho could call their families from their cell phones to do so before they were transported to other \\nhospitals via helicopter. Otherwise, hospital personnel were constrained by the HIPAA law which \\nprevents health practitioners from divulging names. Thus, when calls came in asking for information \\n\\non the whereabouts and condition of students who were being treated, nurses and administrators \\ncould not provide that information, mainly because over the phone, they could not be certain with \\nwhom they were dealing. In some cases. family members who could be there in person were able to \\nget in to see their children. \\nThe hospital set aside their Conference Room for arriving family members and also separate rooms \\naway from media. Snacks and beverages were provided while family members and friends waited \\nfor news. NIU Crisis Staff arrived to assist the social workers at the hospital. Members of the clergy \\nreported to the area to be available to the families. State Police, Sheriff™s Of˜ce, and the Coroner \\narrived between 8:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. to work with the families on matters related to identi˜ca\\n-tion of the wounded and the deceased.\\nThree of the victims at Cole Hall died at the scene, as did the shooter when he committed suicide. \\nTwo other students died of lethal wounds at hospitals: one at Kishwaukee and one who was trans\\n-ported to St. Anthony™s Hospital. Cole Hall was secured by police. The DeKalb County Coroner™s \\n\\nOf˜ce, State Police, and the FBI began moving the human remains to the hospital at midnight. The \\nlast fatality was transported out of Cole Hall at 12:20 a.m., February 15. \\nAt the hospital, personnel from the Coroner™s Of˜ce and State Police met with families to col\\n-lect identifying information, e.g., height, weight, hair color, and markings (tattoos, moles, etc). \\nComplete body x-rays were done for all of the fatalities, the remains cleaned and draped, and positive \\nidenti˜cation made by families. The Coroner then cleaned and draped the remains, the families were \\nthen permitted to make a positive identi˜cation. At St. Anthony™s Medical Center, the Coroner in that \\n\\ncounty identi˜ed that victim, working with the victim™s family. \\nThe hospital administrators and the Coroner worked together to make sure families who wanted \\nrooms at local hotels were able to get them and transportation was provided for them. The Coroner \\n\\nexchanged information with the families so he could contact them the following day. If the families \\nneeded information about a funeral home, the agencies that were staf˜ng the hospital™s family area \\nmade the connections and arrangements. \\nThe next day, maintaining a chain of custody, the remains of the deceased were transferred to the \\nCoroner™s Of˜ce in Sycamore, Illinois, for autopsies. The Coroner had checked with the families as a \\nstandard protocol regarding whether they wanted to donate tissue. As each autopsy was completed, \\nthe Coroner called the family and personally talked to them about his ˜ndings, providing answers to \\n\\ntheir questions and facilitating a level of closure for them. \\nSECOND WAVE OF PATIENTS\\nAfter any major incident, typically there is a second wave of patients who present themselves to \\n\\nclinics or the hospitalŠindividuals who usually have minor injuries, or who are feeling stressed and \\nill after the initial shock of the event passes. Such was the case after the NIU shooting. Kishwaukee \\nCommunity Hospital™s social workers attended to several individuals who sought treatment for \\n\\nminor injuries, the effects of anxiety and stress, and so forth. However, the number was lower than \\nexpected. This was attributed to many students leaving the college and going home until classes \\nresumed on February 25.\\n B-42\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\n33CHAPTER 5: AFTERMATH AND HEALING THE WOUNDS\\nMakeshift memorials to the slain and injured students began appearing on NIU™s campus within \\nhours of the slayings. Flowers, cards, teddy bears, and messages of remembrance were some of the \\nways that mourners used to share their feelings about the tragedy and to join others in tribute to the \\nvictims. People lit candles at a midnight vigil and huddled together for support. On February 19, the \\n\\nTuesday after the shooting, parents of the slain students were escorted by the NIU Police Chief to \\nview the memorials on campus and to enter Cole Hall if they wished. \\nFigure 16: Mourners Participate in Candlelight Vigil\\n The Director of NIU™s counseling and student development center oversaw counseling support ser\\n-vices. At the hospital, NIU crisis staff went directly to the Conference Center at the lower level of \\nthe hospital where a family assistance center had been established. The university began planning a \\nmemorial service to honor the victims of the shooting. In a statement announcing the service, the \\n\\nNIU President set the tone for the memorial as the beginning of a journey toward healing that would \\ntake time. He stated, ﬁThis memorial will initiate a set of activities and services aimed at community \\nrecovery that will continue throughout the semester.ﬂ\\n APPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nB-43\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\n34  U.S. Fire Administration/Technical Report Series\\nFigure 17: Crosses Erected Near the Site of the Shooting\\n One week after the crisis, NIU and the surrounding community observed 5 minutes of silence at \\n3:06 p.m. while bells at the Holmes Student Center and various churches in the area chimed for 5 \\nminutesŠ1 minute for each of the students who died. \\nOn February 24, 10 days after the incident, 12,000 people assembled in the NIU Convocation \\nCenter to honor the slain students, to hear words of encouragement, and to ˜nd emotional support. \\n\\nThe NIU President spoke of hope and the bridges that existed among the attendees and the world. \\nState and Federal of˜cials also spoke about the university community™s strength and ability to move \\nbeyond the sadness of that day.

NIU™s combined chamber and concert choirs sang at the memorial, helping all assembled to \\nsay goodbye and move on to the future. \\nFigure 18: A View of the Packed Convocation Center During Memorial Service\\n B-44\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nUSFA-TR-167/August 2009\\n  \\n35NIU also coordinated nearly 300 counselors who volunteered to assist at NIU. They attended the \\nmemorial service at the Convocation Center and then were positioned in classrooms, residence halls, \\nand department of˜ces to help returning students and faculty cope with the transition and sense of \\nloss once classes resumed. The university hoped that their presence would contribute to healing and \\n\\na sense of unity within the campus community. \\nCRITICAL INCIDENT STRESS \\nFew incidents are as traumatic to responders and witnesses as a mass shooting that involves innocent \\n\\nyoung people. And in small communities, there is a greater likelihood that ˜re and law enforcement \\n\\npersonnel may be acquainted with one or more of the victims. Certainly for the campus community \\n\\nas a whole, the victims were part of the NIU family which experienced great shock over losing fellow \\nstudents and friends. \\nThe City of DeKalb Fire Department took several steps to mitigate the stress among those who \\nresponded to the shooting. Early in the event, the ˜re department issued a department recall which \\n\\nbrought a substantial response from off-duty crews and mutual aid companies. Later during the \\n\\nevening of February 14, the Fire Chief brought the shift that was on duty (and that responded to \\nthe incident) to Station 1, took them off the apparatus and relieved them of their responsibilities. \\nThe department brought in a critical incident stress management team which conducted a diffusing \\n\\nsession with the ˜re˜ghters, after which they were permitted to go home. One of the concerns the \\n\\nFire Chief had was that someone from the college might call in a false alarm about another shooter, \\nand that such a call could magnify the stress the responders already were feeling from having been \\npart of the horri˜c scene at NIU that afternoon. The shift was a tight-knit group and that helped \\n\\nthem work through the issues they faced. The day after the shooting, members of the shift went to \\nlunch togetherŠan event that was supported by the DeKalb Fire˜ghters Local #1236. Other forms \\nof support were provided throughout the ˜re department. \\nOn the following Tuesday night, February 19, a formal debrie˜ng was held for all responders: ˜re\\n-˜ghters/medics, police of˜cers, dispatchers, mutual aid companies and any others who were part \\nof the response at NIU. The debrie˜ng was conducted at the Convocation Center on campus. It is \\nimportant to note that dispatchers were included in the debrie˜ng. Sometimes these personnel are \\noverlooked, but, they, as much as any responder, are under great stress as they process and prioritize \\n\\nall the calls for assistance and the multiple alarms. Often, they do not receive much feedback on out\\n-\\ncomes, but they should, so that they can feel a sense of completion about their role and contribution \\nto the overall management of resources and response.\\nOver the next days and weeks, there were informal conversations as personnel processed the expe\\n-rience with their peers. The ˜re department also reminded all personnel about other options and \\n\\nresources that were available if they needed to talk one-on-one with a professional counselor or \\n\\ndoctor. The ˜re department organized and facilitated two speci˜c technical debrie˜ngs as well. These \\nwere set up to clarify details about the response and to discuss what was successful and why, as well \\nas what changes to procedures and strategies they might want to make. \\nOn February 28, there was a comprehensive medical debrie˜ng session held at the Kishwaukee \\nCommunity Hospital Training Center with the emergency medical responders, the doctor who directs \\nthe Kishwaukee Emergency Department, the DeKalb City Manager, and an NIU Police Lieutenant \\nwho serves as the emergency management coordinator for the campus. The President of the Illinois \\n\\nFire Chiefs, and the Chairman of the EMS Committee of the Illinois Fire Chiefs also sat in on the \\n APPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nB-45\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\n36  \\nU.S. Fire Administration/Technical Report Series\\ndebrie˜ng to learn more about how the response worked and why it was so successful, and what \\nideas should be carried forward to improve future operations.\\nAbout one week following the medical debrie˜ng, the ˜re department directed a review of the ˜re \\nresponse and management of the incident, including coordination with NIU police. Fire department \\nmutual aid companies were represented along with an NIU Police lieutenant. The goal was to con\\n-˜rm the timeline and document key aspects of communications, staging, strategies, and command. \\n\\nThey also discussed some problems that developed and how they were solved. During this meeting, \\n\\nthe ˜re department acknowledged two letters of support that had been sent: one from the Virginia \\nTech Rescue Squad which expressed empathy for what the responders and the university were going \\nthrough and another from a former of˜cer with the Champaign, Illinois, Fire Department who had \\n\\ncoordinated the uni˜ed command classes that many of the responders had attended. He also had \\npromoted the concept of uni˜ed command to the State of Illinois. That training led to changes in \\nemergency management which responders proved they had mastered. They were prepared. \\nA group of DeKalb county volunteers specially trained in critical incident stress services provided \\npost-incident debrie˜ngs for ˜rst responders. Local churches and religious organizations provided \\na number of ﬁCare for the Caregiverﬂ workshops for all who were affected, bringing in a nationally \\n\\nknown speaker. The NIU Employee Assistance Program provided debrie˜ngs for all police of˜cers \\nwho were ˜rst responders; this group received two additional post-incident debrie˜ng sessions. \\nSome of the students, who were among ˜rst responders, were also offered services.\\nAll faculty and staff were offered group and individual sessions, and two-thirds of the university fac\\n-ulty/staff population attended one or more group sessions within a week after the event. Hundreds \\nmore took advantage of individual sessions to help in the response. In addition, further group and \\n\\nindividual sessions were provided for faculty and staff who were involved in or witnessed the events \\nat close range. During the semester, three recovery workshops were offered for faculty and staff, \\nand the university invited the faculty and staff population to special workshops held at the return to \\n\\nclasses in the fall. Additional workshops with recovery themes were made available for both semes\\n-ters of 2009. NIU EAP identi˜ed faculty and staff who had been closely affected by the events, and \\n\\nprovided personal outreach and follow-up discussions with faculty ranging from those who had \\nknown the shooter, those who had provided immediate ˜rst aid and support (e.g., Founders Library, \\nEnglish Department, Women™s Studies, Neptune Hall, Holmes Student Center, Communication, Cole \\n\\nHall basement, carpenters, Sociology and Geology). EAP worked with deans, chairs and administra\\n-tors on what their faculty and staff needed in the aftermath. \\nNIU™s Counseling and Student Development Center offered workshops and groups for students in \\nthe months after February 14, and further workshops on the return to classes in the fall. All of the \\n\\ncampus counseling centers and training sites report that counseling centers have been functioning at \\nor near capacity since February 14, and this trend continues.\\n B-46\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\n37 CHAPTER 6: FINDINGS AND LESSONSNo two disasters are exactly alike. Even though the type of disaster may be familiar territoryŠfor \\nexample, hurricane, ˜ood, or shooting, each one reveals something new about preparedness and \\nresponse which adds to the collective knowledge about what needs to be considered, what works, \\nand what may not work. A mass murder at a university is still a rare event; however, when it occurs \\n\\nit draws signi˚cant national and international interest in the lessons that can be drawn from the \\ntragedy. In the case of the February 14, 2008, slayings at NIU, there are issues that the DeKalb Fire \\nDepartment, the Coroner™s Of˚ce, the NIU Public Affairs Of˚ce, and Kishwaukee Hospital have iden\\n-ti˚ed and shared. In addition, USFA has drawn several other conclusions upon an objective review \\nof the incident.To the community™s great credit, they had been proactive in preparing for a possible incident on \\ncampus, including a mass casualty incident, for many months before the tragedy. And they give \\nsigni˚cant credit to Virginia Tech for unsel˚shly sharing information on a wide variety of topics, \\nincluding how to handle the public information part of critical incident planning several months \\n\\nafter that university suffered their terrible loss. The detailed after action analysis and report on the \\nVirginia Tech incident, which was produced by a special panel and staff appointed by the Governor \\nof Virginia, was mentioned by nearly every of˚ce or department in their debrie˚ngs and conversa\\n-tions as having been a critical source of information for all involved in public safety, emergency \\nmedicine, emergency management, and recovery at the university and the related ˚rst responder \\norganizations. What this proves is that incident critiquing and sharing the results with others suc\\n-ceeds in accomplishing two things: they produce something good out of a wrenching experience, \\nand they make a difference in helping other jurisdictions enhance their strategies and tactics for \\nimproved outcomes based on experience driven by actual events.\\nThe State of Illinois™s campus security initiatives also made a difference. Grant dollars provided \\nradios and special training and bene˚ted many of those who responded to the crisis. Police, ˚re, and \\nemergency medical responders had developed a strong team. That team practiced together, planned \\ntogether, and responded to incidents together in the months and years which preceded the Cole Hall \\n\\nslaying. ﬁRelationships, it™s all about relationshipsﬂ was a commonly voiced conclusion. That same \\n\\nreaction has been documented in USFA™s report on the response to the Minneapolis I-35W Bridge \\nCollapse\\n9Šanother multi-agency, intergovernmental response situation.\\nThere are many speci˚c lessons that can be captured from reviewing the NIU incident. These les\\n-sons are detailed in the following paragraphs, and include con˚rmations of known good practices \\n\\nand discussions of actions or gaps that were problematic. It should be noted that the lessons cover \\nmany aspects of the response, except that USFA did not receive any direct information from the \\n\\nNIU Department of Public Safety, despite attempts to obtain that information. What is mentioned \\nconcerning police operations was derived from hospital, ˚re and EMS, and other after action reports \\nthat included some facts about police response. USFA also collected police department data from the \\n\\nNIU Web site, the annual Clery report, and newspaper articles.\\n  9 I-35 Bridge Collapse and Response USFA-TR-166, March 2008.\\n APPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nB-47\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\n38  U.S. Fire Administration/Technical Report Series\\n1. Planning Together\\nŒAs noted throughout this report, the preparedness planning and training \\nthat was shared among responder organizations contributed to good working relationships, \\ntrust, and the rapid triage, treatment, and transport of the victims.\\n2. Police EMT™s\\nŒThe NIU police of˜cers ˜rst on the scene at Cole Hall used their emergency medi\\n-cal training to great advantage. This training is valuable and noteworthy.\\n3. Noti˜cation of Coroner\\nŒToo much time elapsed between the murders and the formal noti˜ca\\n-tion of the Coroner. Generally, such noti˜cation is made by law enforcement; however in this \\ncase, the hospital contacted the Coroner.\\n4. Public Warning and Information\\nŒNIU™s President immediately authorized activation of \\nthe Emergency Communications Plan. The series of messages that were broadcast were clear, \\ndescribed the situation, and told people what to do. The Public Affairs Of˜ce used the NIU web\\n-site to great advantage. A hotline staffed by Student Affairs handled more than 10,000 parents \\n\\nand family calls in the ˜rst 48 hours. News conferences were well managed and had clear mis\\n-sions. Care was taken to brief all media at the same time.\\n5. Fire Staging\\nŒFire apparatus and ambulances did exactly what they had established and prac\\n-ticedŠthat isŠthey reported to a pre-designated location close to classrooms rather than arrive \\nat the various sites where victims had dispersed. The trust that existed between police and ˜re \\nadded credibility to early assurance that there was only one shooter. Fire personnel knew that \\n\\npolice would not put unarmed ˜re˜ghters in harm™s way. \\n The ˜re department showed good ˚exibility when they changed to the staging location to a \\nsite across from the original site once it became clear that they needed more room and a wider \\nturning radius.\\n6. Fire/EMS Operations\\nŒFire department paramedics and EMTs, along with the police EMTs \\n\\nsaved lives. Victims were assessed and handled per proper procedures for mass casualties. An \\nambulance crew was prudent in collecting and delivering extra backboards and supplies so that \\ninjured victims could be moved quickly into awaiting ambulances. Fire ICS was followed.\\n7. Hospital Response\\nŒKishwaukee Hospital had an emergency plan and set it in motion when \\n\\nthey were alerted to the shooting. The Emergency Department acted quickly to clear and prepare \\nspace and secure additional equipment and personnel. The hospital was secured by law enforce\\n-ment quickly, a good step to take until they could be certain the shooting was not gang-related.\\n8. Coroner™s Response\\nŒThe Coroner came to the hospital once noti˜ed and worked with the \\nfamilies to collect information that would help con˜rm the identity of the deceased. The families \\nwere dealt with sympathetically. They were permitted to view their children as soon as proce\\n-dures and arrangements could make that possible, The Coroner followed up with each family \\npersonally to discuss the procedures that would be taking place by their of˜ce. With the other \\ncare providers at the hospital and public safety personnel, the Corner ensured that families had \\nprovisions for the night and transportation. The following day the Coroner contacted each fam\\n-ily to discuss the ˜ndings of the preliminary autopsies.\\n9. Assistance to Victim™s Families\\nŒNIU™s Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) includes provisions \\nfor assisting victims™ families in the immediate aftermath of a tragedy. Immediately following \\n\\nthe shooting, NIU™s Division of Student Affairs appointed staff liaisons to each of the families of \\n\\nthe deceased and to each injured student and the student™s family. In the earliest hours following \\n B-48\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nUSFA-TR-167/August 2009\\n  39the shooting, liaisons were dispatched to Kishwaukee Community Hospital where family mem\\n-bers had congregated and awaited word on the status of their loved ones. The hospital arranged \\nfor a family assistance area, and that area was suitable for the purpose insofar as it was away from \\nmedia in the hospital and was located where access could be controlled. Social services, faith \\n\\nleaders, counselors from the university and hospital, the Coroner, and State Police all worked on \\nbehalf of the families at the family assistance area the afternoon and evening of the shooting.\\n Several days after the shooting, NIU established the Of˜ce of Support and Advocacy (OSA) \\nto handle the longer-term needs of victims and families. OSA provided central resources and \\n\\none referral point for those students, families, faculty, and staff most directly impacted by the \\nFebruary 14, 2008, tragedy. OSA services include:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nservices; \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsupport efforts; and \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncampus climate sensitive to the experience of those most impacted by the tragedy. \\n In addition to these services, OSA worked with NIU™s Legal Services department to facilitate \\n\\nthe many services available to victims of crime. For example, there is a Federal\\n10 fund that is \\nimplemented at the local level through either the prosecutor™s of˜ce or the police department \\n\\nwhich compensates victims and their families for a variety of expenses related to crime. Travel \\nand funeral expenses, for example, are sometimes included. There is a set death bene˜t to which \\n\\nfamilies are entitled. Victim assistance programs can help families cope with the crime in various \\nways, and those programs were and continue to be used by the victims and families. \\n10. Critical Incident Stress\\nŒThe DeKalb Fire Department took great care to ensure that responders \\nto the shooting were relieved of their duties as soon as was practical the evening of the shoot\\n-ing. They were given a chance to talk and defuse in an informal session led by a professional in \\nthis ˜eld. The department organized a full debrie˜ng shortly thereafter where all personnel who \\nwere involved could process the event. Personnel also were informed of additional services that \\n\\nwere available, and to be aware of the danger signs of stress.\\n NIU acted quickly to establish a variety of support services and counseling venues for all \\n who sought help. Families, students, faculty, and staff were provided many opportunities for \\ncounseling and support in different settings over the weeks and months following the shooting, \\n\\nand into the following academic year.\\n  10 http://www.ncvc.org/ncvc/Main.aspx; http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/ovc/\\n APPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\nB-49\\nAPPENDI\\nX BŒU.S. \\nFI\\nRE ADMINIST\\nRATION\\n/T\\nECHNICAL\\n REPO\\nRT SERIES\\n - NIU SH\\nOOTING\\n40  U.S. Fire Administration/Technical Report Series\\n11.

Often the need for significant involvement beyond simple notification and communication among multiple departments within Student Affairs & Enrollment Management (e.g., the handling of a roommate disagreement) is unnecessary. However, major crises do occur, which require collaborative efforts by several departments within and beyond Student Affairs & Enrollment Management. There is no one outline that can possibly anticipate or cover the wide variety of crises that impact the university community. Ultimately, the development of these procedures should provide a framework to enhance our ability as student-centered professionals to collaboratively meet the challenges presented by student crises.  In defining a crisis, a number of variables need to be considered. In addition to a situation that impacts a student™s ability to meet his/her academic obligation, in this policy ﬁcrisisﬂ is defined as including one or more of the following criteria:  The incident has potential impact on the surrounding community or other individuals. The incident is likely to draw media attention. There may be legal or risk management issues involved. The incident will require continual follow-up or long-term intervention by NIU. As a staff member, you feel somewhat uncomfortable in handling the situation without assistance. If you answered affirmatively to any of these criteria, you are most likely dealing with a crisis. As a rule of thumb, always initiate a call if you are concerned. It is better to be too concerned than not concerned enough. The model presented is an overview of how the Division of Student Affairs & Enrollment Management handles student crises: The Crisis Response Team (CRT) Chair provides central coordination in major crises (e.g., student death, sexual assault, attempted suicide, etc.) response. The Vice President for Student Affairs & Enrollment Management has delegated the responsibility of primary coordination for crisis response to the Chair of the Crisis Response Team. The Crisis Response Team Chair, or the Chair On Duty, should be contacted as soon as possible in reference to a major crisis. Upon notification, the Chair will contact the Vice President for Student Affairs & Enrollment Management. In the absence of the Chair, the full responsibility and authority to manage a crisis will be delegated to an appropriate member of the Crisis Response Team. The Crisis Response Team will convene within 15 minutes after notification of a crisis. Each department within the Division of Student Affairs & Enrollment Management is responsible for coordinating its own personnel, responsibilities, and procedures, given the unique nature of each unit™s specialization. Each department is responsible for identifying the appropriate individual who will coordinate the individual unit™s communications, consultations, and participation on the Crisis Response Team within the Division of Student Affairs & Enrollment Management.  APPENDI\\nX CŒCR\\nISIS\\n RESPONSE\\n POLIC\\nY AND\\n PR\\nOCEDU\\nRE (P\\nURPOSE\\n AND\\n PH\\nILOSOP\\nHY \\nSECTION\\n)C-4\\nAPPENDI\\nX CŒCR\\nISIS\\n RESPONSE\\n POLIC\\nY AND\\n PR\\nOCEDU\\nRE (P\\nURPOSE\\n AND\\n PH\\nILOSOP\\nHY \\nSECTION\\n) After the crisis has been addressed, the Chair will schedule a meeting of the Crisis Response Team for debriefing. The Crisis Response Team will be comprised of a representative of each department involved in the student crisis. The Crisis Response Team will develop a plan of response and monitoring, as deemed appropriate. Additional debriefing sessions may be initiated and implemented, particularly when a crisis may have significant reverberations within the university community. Standard Operation Procedures The unique nature of what is defined as a crisis will determine the plan of action in the Division™s response, including communications, individual participation, area of operation, and the roles of the CRT members. However, for most crises, there will be some standard operating procedures (SOPs) that will go into effect during the central coordination of a major crisis. LocationŠThe main area of operation during the crisis is the Vice President™s (VP™s) suite (Altgeld 208). If Altgeld 208 is uninhabitable during a crisis, an alternate location for the ﬁoperation centerﬂ is Career Services Offices (Campus Life Building). Phone BankŠIn responding to a crisis, the Division of Student Affairs & Enrollment Management may establish a phone bank using the six lines in the VP™s suite. Also, based on the volume of calls, seven additional lines from the Provost™s office area may be used to receive incoming calls or for secondary calls. If the phone bank is activated, staff identified (see below) to operate the phones will be alerted and scheduled accordingly. A telephone call log and computer at each phone location will be used to keep track of incoming calls, to provide answers to questions, and to update the staff with campus information. Below are the phone numbers that will become part of the phone bank: I. Phone numbers from VP for Student Affairs & Enrollment Management suite:  II. Phone numbers from Provost Office:                        (815) 753-0408  (815) 753-1573  (815) 753-8508  (815) 753-1574  (815) 753-8377  (815) 753-1575  (815) 753-8378  (815) 753-1585  (815) 753-8381  (815) 753-6257  (815) 753-8380  (815) 753-9564  (815) 753-0492 CommunicationŠIf cellular phones become inoperable, Student Involvement & Leadership Development (SILD) has 12 FM radios that will be distributed to key CRT members and used for local communication. The location and capabilities of the radios are noted below.  Radios are located in Campus Life Building 170. Any full-time SILD staff member can get access to them at any time (NIU Police also have master keys to the building and can open the door if no SILD staff member is available). Radios operate on the NIU repeater (same type of radio system used by NIU Police, Grounds, NIUTEL, etc.). This may be important to note because, if the repeater ever fails, the radios would not be operable.  Other radio resources:  ITS/NIUTEL have radios that can be rented by departments.  Holmes Student Center and the Convocation Center both utilize radios in daily operation, and may have some that could be accessed for emergency use.

Although staff members are divided into two roles in order to increase effectiveness, both roles are equally important. The two roles are Phone Bank Shift Leaders and Phone Responders.

PR\\nOGRAM\\nAppendix\\n 1   Classroom Outreach Program  Logistics Placing a clinician in each class when courses resume will provide multiple benefits for faculty and students alike. Specifically, it will provide on-site support for students who experience various emotions upon returning to campus, and it will also assist faculty in addressing questions or concerns raised by students regarding the crisis. For most campuses, large or small, this type of classroom outreach program requires special preparation as well as the coordination of multiple volunteers. At a macro level, the goal should be to have one counselor in each class for the first 2 days of classes. This will provide coverage for classes that meet on alternate days. To maintain manageability, the counselor-to\\n-student ratio should not exceed 1 to 100 (i.e., a lecture with 200 students requires a minimum of two counselors).  Calls and e-mails offering volunteer assistance will begin immediately and will come from many sources including other universities, private mental health professionals, clergy, and the general public. The crisis hotlines will receive most of these calls; hotline operators will require direction for organizing the information offered by prospective volunteers. To that end, a form should be created for hotline staff to collect predetermined information from those offering assistance, specifically clinicians. The form should include   contact information (name, e-mail address, cell phone number, campus/agency, etc.)  number of days the volunteer can assist, including arrival and departure times (It is important to note that volunteer time slots should be predetermined to cover class schedules; this will provide more thorough classroom coverage, but may result in some volunteers being turned away as their availability does not match the scheduled slots.)  volunteer™s mobility issues, if any  volunteer™s other languages (including sign language)  volunteer™s professional license status  Hotline operators should be equipped with multiple copies of the form to complete as they answer the phone, and the form should also be available on the institution™s Web site. If possible, potential volunteers should be able to submit the form directly online.   \\nSome potential volunteers will contact staff members they already know and offer assistance. These individuals will provide some of the information required, but additional information will still be needed, making it necessary to contact volunteers directly. These potential volunteers should be contacted, thanked for their offer of assistance, and asked to complete the volunteer assistance form online.    I-3\\nAPPENDI\\nX IŒC\\nLASS\\nROOM O\\nUT\\nREAC\\nH PR\\nOGRAM\\nAPPENDI\\nX IŒC\\nLASS\\nROOM O\\nUT\\nREAC\\nH PR\\nOGRAM\\nAt the same time the volunteer corps is being assembled, area hotels should be contacted to secure rooms for the clinicians. The local visitor™s bureau or tourism office will be of assistance with this logistical task because of their preexisting relationships with area merchants. Securing rooms as quickly as possible is critical because media may descend on the campus and consume many of the rooms that will be needed.  The visitor™s bureau may also be a good resource for contacting local restaurants. When the shooting occurred at Northern Illinois University, restaurants donated enough food to feed over 500 volunteers during their stay on campus. A solicitation letter/e\\n-mail can be written ahead of time as part of your crisis management plan, making it possible to simply edit and send if necessary.  Another critical step in preparing for a crisis is meeting with the university™s registrar to develop an understanding of the capabilities of your campus™s software and a plan for scheduling volunteers. Determine if the registrar™s data system has the ability to build volunteer schedules. Ideally, different types of schedules would be designed (e.g., 2 day or 1 day) that would align with the time slots offered on the volunteer assistance form. If this is not possible, work with your information technology department to identify staff members to assist with scheduling the volunteers. It will be vital to secure a master class schedule for the campus and to request the enrollment figure of each class so that appropriate coverage is scheduled. The registrar™s office may have to alter the class schedule if the crisis affected a classroom space requiring it to be closed or taken off line for scheduling purposes. Any change will initiate a domino effect through the schedule that will have an impact on volunteer assignments. It is critical that the team scheduling the volunteers be made aware of any changes to the master class schedule.  A specific issue that is more relevant to larger institutions is the placement of volunteer clinicians into zones. By dividing the campus into smaller regions or zones and assigning clinicians to a single zone, those who are unfamiliar with the campus will be able to better navigate their classroom assignments. Additionally, should volunteers have to cover classrooms not originally assigned to them, keeping the volunteers within their zone will ease their travel to the new assignment. The zoning of a campus is an important planning detail related to the scheduling of classes mentioned earlier; volunteer schedules should be confined to one zone for efficiency and effectiveness of the outreach effort. \\n Each zone should ideally have a hospitality center where counselors may wait between assignments and debrief with one another. If possible, providing any destressing activity, such as a massage therapist, is beneficial and will be appreciated. The hospitality centers also provide multiple locations for staging volunteers to cover any unforeseen schedule changes. Each hospitality center must have a phone, assigned staff from the university to coordinate volunteer efforts and answer questions, food and beverages, and message boards.  Finally, an orientation for all volunteer counselors will be necessary. In the crisis planning, identify three separate locations on campus that will accommodate the size of the volunteer  APPENDI\\nX IŒC\\nLASS\\nROOM O\\nUT\\nREAC\\nH PR\\nOGRAM\\nI-4\\nAPPENDI\\nX IŒC\\nLASS\\nROOM O\\nUT\\nREAC\\nH PR\\nOGRAM\\ngroup. This is necessary as one or more of the selected spaces may be reassigned for a different purpose. Conceptualize the orientation as a large conference. Provide a comfortable, warm, and dry area for registration and be mindful that the majority of volunteers will be arriving in a short period of time. To this end, check-in should be highly organized, well staffed, and provide enough room for queues inside. Networked computer(s) and a copier at registration will allow for on-site\\n verification and making copies of volunteers™ mental health licenses. The orientation should bring volunteers up to date on the crisis, review schedules and the purpose of the hospitality centers, address parking and transportation needs, and outline the role of the counselors in the classroom.

Recovery requires a sense of social community in which people feel supported in looking back and forwardﬂ (Eyre, 2006, p. 454). An important component in the university™s crisis response is providing opportunities for members of the community to gather and to express themselves in mourning. These expressions of mourning can take many forms with varying degrees of formality and planning.  Community gatherings can be powerful events for an institution in crisis. Researchers ﬁhave reinforced the significance of social support for those who are traumatized, including the value of social\\n responses to death, grief, and mourningﬂ (Eyre, 2006, p. 443), and these gatherings provide that opportunity. Not only do they allow the members of a community to be with one another, but they also provide an opportunity for all the people at the university to see their president and institutional leadership not on the television or computer screen but speaking directly to them. Candlelight vigils in the aftermath of a tragedy have become a ritual in our society.   In addition to community gatherings, providing a space for personal reflection is another simple but important resource for a healing community. At institutions that may not have a campus chapel, a quiet room designated for reflection can be used. According to Eyre (2006), Designating a location for group or personal meditation, whether permanent or temporary, can help people healﬂ (p. 447).  \\nAnother space for reflection can be found in the written word. Within 24 hours of the shooting at Northern Illinois University, campus administrators placed message boards in the center of the campus. These boards not only offered a place for expression but also provided a location for people to gather and connect with others struggling with the effects of the tragedy.   The practice of ﬁremembering in silenceﬂ (Eyre, 2006, p. 448) is centuries old, and it remains a meaningful way a community can reflect, observe, and unite after a campus tragedy. Northern Illinois University, 7 days to the minute after its shooting tragedy, commemorated the event with 5 minutes of silence.   Many institutions provide memorial services for loss of any life in the campus community.   Formal memorial services often follow some time after the initial aftermath of the communal tragedies, allowing for a more extended period of time for planning and organization. Their location, formality, and content symbolize the sense, scale, and significance of the communal loss. (Eyre, 2006, p. 450)  The memorial service at Virginia Tech was not only a ritual of healing for the campus, it was \\nalso an international event broadcast live worldwide. Because of the public nature of this type of event, the institution must use adequate time, staff, and resources to make sure the university is  J-3\\nAPPENDI\\nX JŒOPPO\\nRTUNITIES\\n TO\\n HEAL\\nAPPENDI\\nX JŒOPPO\\nRTUNITIES\\n TO\\n HEAL\\nappropriately represented. Knowing that the service is \\nvery public, exceptional care should be taken regarding the families of the victims and those who survived the incident. A special reception prior to or after the event allows families to interact with one another and institutional leaders to express their condolences in a more intimate setting.  It is important to commemorate milestones. Community expressions can ﬁmark the transitions of time and status for individuals and the communityﬂ (Eyre, 2006, p. 455). The passing of 365 days after a shooting is a milestone for the institution and the community.  In the same way as formal memorial services conducted shortly after a tragedy fulfill both psychological and social functions, so do anniversary events. They mark the passage of social and chronological time as well as the impetus and long journey toward community rehabilitation and recovery. (p. 451)  The commemorative events must balance respect for the victims, honor the resilience of the survivors, and recognize the hope and rebuilding manifested during the previous year. Involving the campus and greater community in planning the events is an opportunity to continue to strengthen relationships across and beyond the campus. Administrators at Virginia Tech and Northern Illinois University provided a full day of events designed to offer opportunities for memorial expressions in many forms, including musical performances, art displays, multifaith services, rooms for reflection, and a reception where injured students, victims™ families, and the university™s leadership had the opportunity to formally thank the emergency personnel who were first on the scene. On this day, events and traditions can be established that will be carried forward at the annual commemoration of the tragedy for years to come. This is an important time for solidarity and remembrance.  \\nGraduation is an annual milestone at every university. The conferring of posthumous degrees upon those lost in the tragedy is another opportunity for reflection and healing for the campus community as it convenes during this significant ritual.  \\nAn institution may respond to the task of healing a community following a crisis in a number of ways; providing safe spaces for reflection and mourning, moments of silence, candlelight vigils, \\nand permanent memorials are just a few examples. While insufficient research does not provide guidance on what specific initiatives are most effective in the healing process, there is no question that when a crisis occurs on a college campus, an appropriate response implemented by the institution is expected.  The institution has a responsibility to provide opportunities for people to heal following a tragedy. These opportunities are the foundation for an institution to lead its community to a new normal. A university creates partnerships with a grieving, helpful community. Hand in hand, they move through the recovery process while challenged by many unfamiliar tasks, such as receiving the overwhelming number of expressions of condolences and planning commemoration ceremonies the world will watch. Throughout every component of the healing process, those charged with creating and implementing each event must remain aware of issues of sensitivity that may affect the grieving process, including issues of faith, politics, and integrity. A \\nuniversity should be mindful of its message to constituents, to the media, and to the  APPENDI\\nX JŒOPPO\\nRTUNITIES\\n TO\\n HEAL\\nJ-4\\nAPPENDI\\nX JŒOPPO\\nRTUNITIES\\n TO\\n HEAL\\nworld. Whether through programs, rituals, or policies, a university must also give consideration to long-term healing.  Most importantly, the healing initiatives in the aftermath of a crisis show the world the heart and soul of the institution. Although the community is faced with an inconceivable reality, ﬁtragedy is the author of hopeﬂ (Bolman & Deal, 1995, p. 35). The response should embody the values of the institution and move the community toward a renewed sense of purpose and a commitment to move forward.   References\\n  \\nBolman, L., & Deal, T. (1995).

As faculty and staff experience their own emotional reactions to the tragedy, they may have strong feelings about returning to work or the classroom. When individuals return to an area of mass violence, they may become extremely upset or overwhelmed (DHHS, 2004). Counselors should be prepared to assist faculty and staff who are anxious about students returning as well as about dealing with their own emotions. Particular attention should be paid to the faculty and staff who were more directly affected by the tragedy. For example, the academic department where the tragedy occurred, faculty who advise student groups that were directly affected, and individuals who lost a student or family member may require additional attention.  Outreach sessions or meetings should be provided for all faculty, staff, and graduate/teaching assistants prior to the resumption of classes. To accomplish this, heavy involvement from academic affairs will be necessary to communicate effectively the agenda and purpose of the sessions and to encourage attendance. Sessions should be organized by academic departments, allowing participants to attend sessions with their colleagues. Likewise, it will keep departments that were affected in different ways separate from one another, which provides a critical level of emotional safety for participants. In the case of a shooting, some faculty members may have known the shooter personally, as well as the victim(s); this dynamic will complicate emotional response. Faculty members who have students who were directly affected by the shooting (students killed or in the classroom) should be notified regarding those students. This information will allow them to be more prepared for absences when classes resume and to pay particular attention to students directly affected who return to class.  Sessions for faculty should be scheduled for 90 minutes to 2 hours and should be led by counselors with expertise in college student mental health and crisis work. The agenda should include information on grieving and crisis reactions (Ku¨ bler-Ross, 1969), mental health resources, and education about the classroom outreach program. Resources should be made available to participants (see the American Psychological Association™s Help Center at http://www.APAhelpcenter.org for handout brochures and other materials) and should be distributed in multiple formats (e.g. hard copy, Web based, and e-mail). Most importantly, the formal agenda should be brief, allowing the majority of the time to be spent addressing questions and concerns and allowing participants to process their own reactions.
